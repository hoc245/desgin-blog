      "body": "<p><strong>Thematic analysis</strong>&nbsp;is a method of analyzing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/qualitative-research/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">qualitative data</a>. It is usually applied to a set of texts, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/interviews-research/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an interview</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/transcribe-interview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">transcripts</a>. The researcher closely examines the data to identify common themes – topics, ideas and patterns of meaning that come up repeatedly.</p><p>There are various approaches to conducting thematic analysis, but the most common form follows a six-step process: familiarization, coding, generating themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes, and writing up.</p><p>This process was originally developed for psychology research&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/thematic-analysis.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Braun and Victoria Clarke</a>. However, thematic analysis is a flexible method that can be adapted to many different kinds of research.</p><p><br></p><h2>When to use thematic analysis</h2><p>Thematic analysis is a good approach to research where you’re trying to find out something about people’s views, opinions, knowledge, experiences or values from a set of qualitative data – for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/transcribe-interview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interview transcripts</a>, social media profiles, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/survey-research/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">survey responses</a>.</p><p>Some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/research-questions/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">types of research questions</a>&nbsp;you might use thematic analysis to answer:</p><ul><li>How do patients&nbsp;<strong>perceive</strong>&nbsp;doctors in a hospital setting?</li><li>What are young women’s&nbsp;<strong>experiences</strong>&nbsp;on dating sites?</li><li>What are non-experts’&nbsp;<strong>ideas and opinions</strong>&nbsp;about climate change?</li><li>How is gender&nbsp;<strong>constructed</strong>&nbsp;in high school history teaching?</li></ul><p>To answer any of these questions, you would collect data from a group of relevant participants and then analyze it. Thematic analysis allows you a lot of flexibility in interpreting the data, and allows you to approach large data sets more easily by sorting them into broad themes.</p><p>However, it also involves the risk of missing nuances in the data. Thematic analysis is often quite subjective and relies on the researcher’s judgement, so you have to reflect carefully on your own choices and interpretations.</p><p>Pay close attention to the data to ensure that you’re not picking up on things that are not there – or obscuring things that are.</p><p><br></p><h2>Different approaches to thematic analysis</h2><p>Once you’ve decided to use thematic analysis, there are different approaches to consider.</p><p>There’s the distinction between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/inductive-deductive-reasoning/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inductive and deductive</a>&nbsp;approaches:</p><ul><li>An&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/inductive-reasoning/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">inductive approach</a>&nbsp;involves allowing the data to determine your themes.</li><li>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/deductive-reasoning/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">deductive approach</a>&nbsp;involves coming to the data with some preconceived themes you expect to find reflected there, based on theory or existing knowledge.</li></ul><p>Ask yourself: Does my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/research-paper/theoretical-framework/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theoretical framework</a>&nbsp;give me a strong idea of what kind of themes I expect to find in the data (deductive), or am I planning to develop my own framework based on what I find (inductive)?</p><p>There’s also the distinction between a semantic and a latent approach:</p><ul><li>A semantic approach involves analyzing the explicit content of the data.</li><li>A latent approach involves reading into the subtext and assumptions underlying the data.</li></ul><p>Ask yourself: Am I interested in people’s stated opinions (semantic) or in what their statements reveal about their assumptions and social context (latent)?</p><p>After you’ve decided thematic analysis is the right method for analyzing your data, and you’ve thought about the approach you’re going to take, you can follow the six steps developed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1191/1478088706qp063oa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Braun and Clarke</a>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Step 1: Familiarization</h2><p>The first step is to get to know our data. It’s important to get a thorough overview of all the data we collected before we start analyzing individual items.</p><p>This might involve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/transcribe-interview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">transcribing audio</a>, reading through the text and taking initial notes, and generally looking through the data to get familiar with it.</p><p><br></p><h2>Step 2: Coding</h2><p>Next up, we need to code the data. Coding means highlighting sections of our text – usually phrases or sentences – and coming up with shorthand labels or “codes” to describe their content.</p><p>Let’s take a short example text. Say we’re researching perceptions of climate change among conservative voters aged 50 and up, and we have collected data through a series of interviews. An extract from one interview looks like this:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Coding qualitative data</strong></p><p><strong>Interview extract</strong></p><ul><li>Personally,&nbsp;I’m not sure. I think&nbsp;the climate is changing, sure, but&nbsp;I don’t know why or how. People say you should trust the experts, but&nbsp;who’s to say they don’t have their own reasons for pushing this narrative? I’m not saying they’re wrong, I’m just saying&nbsp;there’s reasons not to 100% trust them. The facts keep changing –&nbsp;it used to be called global warming.</li></ul><p><strong>Codes:</strong></p><ul><li>Uncertainty</li><li>Acknowledgement of climate change</li><li>Distrust of experts</li><li>Changing terminology</li></ul><p><br></p><p>In this extract, we’ve highlighted various phrases in different colors corresponding to different codes. Each code describes the idea or feeling expressed in that part of the text.</p><p>At this stage, we want to be thorough: we go through the transcript of every interview and highlight everything that jumps out as relevant or potentially interesting. As well as highlighting all the phrases and sentences that match these codes, we can keep adding new codes as we go through the text.</p><p>After we’ve been through the text, we collate together all the data into groups identified by code. These codes allow us to gain a a condensed overview of the main points and common meanings that recur throughout the data.</p><p><br></p><h2>Step 3: Generating themes</h2><p>Next, we look over the codes we’ve created, identify patterns among them, and start coming up with themes.</p><p>Themes are generally broader than codes. Most of the time, you’ll combine several codes into a single theme. In our example, we might start combining codes into themes like this:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Turning codes into themes</strong></p><p><strong>Codes:</strong></p><ul><li>Uncertainty</li><li>Leave it to the experts</li><li>Alternative explanations</li><li>Changing terminology</li><li>Distrust of scientists</li><li>Resentment toward experts</li><li>Fear of government control</li><li>Incorrect facts</li><li>Misunderstanding of science</li><li>Biased media sources</li></ul><p><strong>Theme:</strong></p><ul><li>Uncertainty</li><li>Distrust of experts</li><li>Misinformation</li></ul><p><br></p><p>At this stage, we might decide that some of our codes are too vague or not relevant enough (for example, because they don’t appear very often in the data), so they can be discarded.</p><p>Other codes might become themes in their own right. In our example, we decided that the code “uncertainty” made sense as a theme, with some other codes incorporated into it.</p><p>Again, what we decide will vary according to what we’re trying to find out. We want to create potential themes that tell us something helpful about the data for our purposes.</p><p><br></p><h2>Step 4: Reviewing themes</h2><p>Now we have to make sure that our themes are useful and accurate representations of the data. Here, we return to the data set and compare our themes against it. Are we missing anything? Are these themes really present in the data? What can we change to make our themes work better?</p><p>If we encounter problems with our themes, we might split them up, combine them, discard them or create new ones: whatever makes them more useful and accurate.</p><p>For example, we might decide upon looking through the data that “changing terminology” fits better under the “uncertainty” theme than under “distrust of experts,” since the data labelled with this code involves confusion, not necessarily distrust.</p><h2>Step 5: Defining and naming themes</h2><p>Now that you have a final list of themes, it’s time to name and define each of them.</p><p>Defining themes involves formulating exactly what we mean by each theme and figuring out how it helps us understand the data.</p><p>Naming themes involves coming up with a succinct and easily understandable name for each theme.</p><p>For example, we might look at “distrust of experts” and determine exactly who we mean by “experts” in this theme. We might decide that a better name for the theme is “distrust of authority” or “conspiracy thinking”.</p><h2>Step 6: Writing up</h2><p>Finally, we’ll write up our analysis of the data.&nbsp;Like all academic texts, writing up a thematic analysis requires an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/introduction-structure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">introduction</a>&nbsp;to establish our research question, aims and approach.</p><p>We should also include a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/methodology/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">methodology</a>&nbsp;section, describing how we collected the data (e.g. through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/semi-structured-interview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">semi-structured interviews</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/survey-research/#step-three-design-the-survey-questions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open-ended survey questions</a>) and explaining how we conducted the thematic analysis itself.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/results/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">results</a>&nbsp;or findings section usually addresses each theme in turn. We describe how often the themes come up and what they mean, including examples&nbsp;from the data as evidence. Finally, our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/write-conclusion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">conclusion</a>&nbsp;explains the main takeaways and shows how the analysis has answered our research question.</p><p>In our example, we might argue that conspiracy thinking about climate change is widespread among older conservative voters, point out the uncertainty with which many voters view the issue, and discuss the role of misinformation in respondents’ perceptions.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When you first land on your job as a UX Designer or as an intern, first week or two might pass without any pressure. Developers might give you the requirements and you might use your existing knowledge about the tools to design what they have requested from you. You may deliver whatever the things you designed or you might spend the first two weeks designing that one task you were given.</p><p>If you joined a project which is few sprints old, you will soon realize that more often than not, the developers are waiting until your design is finalized and delivered to them. If your project consist of several applications and if you are the only UX person in the project, you will feel the pressure soon enough. Nothing hurts more, than someone being idle until your work is delivered.</p><p>That’s one of the many reasons why you need to have an UX process, for you or for a particular project.</p><p>Before I begin, I have to mention that&nbsp;when I was a beginner UX process was one of the most confusing things to me because I read about different descriptions and different terms by different authors and back then I couldn’t figure out how to really execute a UX process and why different authors have differently described it.</p><p>Just like you can’t learn to swim without getting into the water, you will not understand a UX process until you actually apply it to a project&nbsp;and it’s something that evolves with the experience you gain.</p><p>So Let me explain how I figured it out with both theorems and experience.</p><h2>What’s a UX process?</h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*lVzcHLM6RLqTBtd5vq8Ogg.jpeg\"></p><p>via&nbsp;<a href=\"http://uxdesign.com/assets/ux-defined/ux-process-diagram.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://uxdesign.com</a></p><p>UX process is an iterative method which helps you to continuously improve and polish your designs.</p><p>There is something which must be included in a UX process to qualify a process to be an actual UX process: that is, your UX process must get the user input as much as possible at each phase where you will be able to incorporate user feedback in to your product design.</p><p>So we can re-word it like this:</p><blockquote><em>UX process is an iterative method which helps you to continuously improve and polish your designs with user feedback.</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Also, one thing you should know is: A UX process can be different from one UX designer to another, organization to organization and sometimes depending on the project.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/620/1*jQpBXVLLq5zn_ln1U4bFVA.png\"></p><p>via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uxmastery.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://uxmastery.com</a></p><p>Few factors that will cause to have different UX processes:</p><ol><li>The project</li><li>The client</li><li>The budget</li><li>The deadlines</li><li>Experience level of the UX designer</li></ol><h2>Why you need a UX process?</h2><p>Before diving into explore phases of a UX process, its characteristics and how they contribute at different phases of the UX process, knowing why you need a UX process will help you to understand the importance of the UX process better.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1.Which technique, When and How.</strong></p><p>You can select which techniques out of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uxmastery.com/resources/techniques/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">range of techniques</a>&nbsp;available in UX design, to use depending on your needs and factors mentioned above and decide when and how to use those techniques. Because all the techniques might not be necessary for a project, so you have to pick them wisely.</p><p><strong>2.Keeps everyone on the same page</strong></p><p>As a UX designer you are designing or always have in mind about the way you are going to execute the project in terms of UX. Since projects are always a team work, you need to communicate what you are going to do, to a bunch of people who will be working with you. Having a UX process will help you to explain it easier and in a more clear manner.</p><p><strong>3.Show your competency and experience level</strong></p><p>Apart from being useful for a particular project, your general UX process which you may showcase in your portfolio for your clients or recruiters to see, will give an idea about the level of experience you have. If it’s an organization, your organization’s UX process will showcase the maturity of the UX team in your organization.</p><p><strong>4. Help you to decide numbers for your work</strong></p><p>By having a UX process, you can decide which techniques you will be using for each phase and with experience you will know how much time it will take to complete those&nbsp;which will help you in making your estimation and if you are a freelancer, based on this you can decide your ratings.</p><h2>Key characteristics of a UX process</h2><p>First of all, I have used the word “Key Characteristics” instead of using “Stages” because I did not want you to get confused the stages with the phases that I will be explaining later. Phases will be defined based on the factors like type of the project, deadline and preferences of the UX designer. So let’s call them characteristics of a UX process and the phases will contain one or more of those characteristics.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>1.Strategy</strong></p><p>Here we are referring to few activities, such as: Articulating the brand, guiding principals of the project, defining long term goals of the organization, goals of the project, how to measure success of the project and priority of the things to achieve.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/545/1*Dfxq8fCZDenQs9fGA9087Q.png\"></p><p>via&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dtelepathy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.dtelepathy.com</a></p><p><strong>2.Research</strong></p><p>Also referred to as Discovery. This is the most variable characteristic between projects and depending the UX strategy you will be using for your project (Lean UX and Agile UX).</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*5xmS_jE9RKGz1Pj0jmScPQ.png\"></p><p>via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careerfoundry.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://careerfoundry.com</a></p><p>Surprisingly, research has the most tendency to be skipped, but it is&nbsp;<strong><em>the key to creating an informed user experience&nbsp;</em></strong>and what makes a process into a real UX process.&nbsp;Competitor research and user research are two good examples for the use of this characteristic in UX process.</p><p><strong>3.Analysis</strong></p><p>Analysis is where the UX designers understands the “Why” from “What”.</p><p>“What” — the insights from collected data during the research.</p><p>“Why” — confirmation of the assumptions made by the UX designer to the end users.</p><p>In order to understand “Why” from “What”, we need to capture, organize and make inferences on the collected data during the research.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/469/1*RgkluO-dINTQF36-4V-A3w.png\"></p><p>via&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.pinterest.com</a></p><p>I am pretty sure that you have heard the above quote by Steve Jobs. This is actually what is done by analysis. User may tell you the things they think they want directly but with research findings you can actually find the things which they are actually in need of. This is what we do with analysis and we as UX designers communicate our understanding back to the end users, confirming on our assumptions. This is how we introduce improvements to functionality or may be functionality and features directly.</p><p><strong>4. Design</strong></p><p>Design is collaborative and iterative.</p><p>Collaborative — involves input and ideas from different people. Those people could be the client, your team of developers and other stakeholders.</p><p>Iterative — cycles back upon itself to validate ideas and assumptions.</p><p>Design puts ideas in front of users, gets feedback, refines the design and repeats this process until the client and UX designer both are satisfied.</p><p>This design does not involve any graphic identity, branding and visual details because we do not want to distract users from the design of the solution. It only involves the low fidelity designs such as paper prototypes, interactive wire frames and semi functioning prototypes.</p><p><strong>5.Production</strong></p><p>This is where we do the things we didn’t do with the design. High fidelity design is fleshed out at the production. The content, digital assets will be created and graphic identity, branding and visual details will be added.</p><p>Also, this is where we validate the high fidelity design with end users and stakeholders with user testing, along with collaboration of developers.</p><h1>It almost sounds like Waterfall model but we are following Agile!</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/698/1*StCeGakz0kc_xvWtpGhJxA.png\"></p><p>Requiring work on each plane to finish before work on the next can start leads to unsatisfactory results for you and your users. — Jesse James Garrett “Elements of User Experience”</p><p>Above image is a perfect example for what you have in mind after reading the characteristics and Yes! that’s NOT what you should do.</p><p>This is where the best practices comes to play.</p><p>You have complete freedom to overlap and iterate between those characteristics.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*MLlm53loWwe_V9YyTJLSrA.png\"></p><p>A better approach is to have work on each plane finish before work on the next can finish. — Jesse James Garrett “Elements of User Experience”</p><p>So, all you have to do is to&nbsp;<strong>finish</strong>&nbsp;the work of one phase&nbsp;<strong>before you finish&nbsp;</strong>the the work on the next phase.</p><h1>But you said “phase” where’re the “Characteristics”?</h1><p>Let’s take the planes /phases explained by Jesse James Garrett as an example for a general UX process and discuss where are the characteristics in it.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/491/1*-iO9imbT9eCZEcUdwaVqrQ.png\"></p><p>Elements /Planes of UX — Jesse James Garrett</p><p>Again a reminder, we are not following this as a waterfall model, we do overlap and iterate going back and forth with feedback from users and stakeholders.</p><h2><strong>Strategy Phase</strong></h2><p><strong>What happens in this phase?</strong></p><p><br></p><ol><li>Determining scope</li><li>Incorporating what users want to get out of the product — User needs</li><li>Incorporating the business goals</li></ol><p><strong>Characteristic/characteristics involved:</strong></p><ul><li><strong><em>Strategy —&nbsp;</em></strong><em>You will define the scope of the product/project and the business goals by taking the points mentioned in the strategy characteristic and it’s&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://uxmastery.com/resources/techniques/?table_filter=strategy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>techniques</em></a></li><li><strong><em>Research —&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Also, in order to define your business goals and user needs you will have to run few of the competitor/ Market researches and user researches.

Over many years, they pooled information and knowledge by witnessing group environments and how these groups worked &amp; collaborated together. This knowledge was used to make the group Works deck the most impactful and useful as possible.</p><h1>Meet the Team</h1><p>As a team, our task was to digitize this set of Group Works cards into an app that represented the original card deck and provided solutions to issues that the current card deck users were experiencing. The app is meant to assist users to plan for meetings more efficiently and emulate the physical deck rather than replacing it.</p><p><br></p><p>Before I dive into the research section, I wanted to elaborate that we worked collaboratively as a team consisting of both UX and UI students and would like to introduce our team below!</p><p>Our team consisted of 5 members, two of whom are UX students and three UI. Natiea and Ethan were part of the UX team, and myself, Jeremy, and Halina made up the UI part of the team.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*HW-Oblo_3NwPNY_trgt6SA.png\"></p><p>Natiea and Ethan (UX), and Jeremy, Jessica &amp; Halina (UI)</p><h1>Research</h1><p>Following our initial client kickoff meeting, we combined the information from the meeting as well as online research to create a list of key points to keep in mind during the app design. We researched other tarot card apps although there was quite a limited range, so we searched dribbble for inspiration for card design as well as other modern apps designed for group collaboration. The key findings from both the kickoff meeting and online research were:</p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>Stay true to the roots of card design</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Keep layout clean &amp; simple, and easy to understand for current users/new users</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Keep rainbow color palette on physical cards, play with imagery + graphics</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Design app for ability to be applied in a corporate environment while remaining playful</em></blockquote><p>The business goals behind this project were to create an app that again, emulated the card design rather than replacing it, and an app that portrayed the reasoning behind why the original card deck was created. To reiterate this, the app is primarily used to support facilitators in executing group gatherings.</p><h1>Target Audience/Persona</h1><p>As a team, we determined our target audience and user persona as a basis for the rest of the project. Our persona inspires our team’s design decisions as this is an example of an individual we will be designing the app for. They influence our decisions along with other parts of the project including research and gut test results, which I will explain further on.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*VKw15rN1c9S-t-QH5BYxXQ.png\"></p><p>Target Audience</p><p>After doing our research as a team and analyzing the information/results, we determined that our target audience was current users of the card deck, as well as new users. This meant we had to design an app that was clean, simple, and easy to understand for current users. We had to ensure there was not a disconnect between the current physical deck and the app we were designing, and that current users were able to easily familiarize themselves with the app. We also had to ensure it was easy for new users to learn and understand how the cards worked by including an information section in the app. This part of the process set a solid base for our design decisions which will be explained throughout the rest of my case study.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*cN1zDXBHUOACcg7NuRfr_w.png\"></p><p>User Persona</p><p>After determining our target audience, the UX team created our persona and provided it to the UI team to assist and inspire the design process. Our persona is:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Maggie Richards</em></strong></blockquote><p><br></p><ul><li>44 years old</li><li>Facilitator and Educator</li></ul><blockquote><strong><em>Mindset:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;“I love using the Group Works Card Deck to bring life and dynamism to my meetings, but I find using the physical cards alone for planning my meetings is a bit limited. I need more functionality.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Need for the App:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;“When I’m planning for meetings, I want to be able to group cards together and make notes on those collections. It would be nice to have the ability to do it all in one place without the need for sticky notes and other materials.”</em></blockquote><h1>The UI Design Process</h1><h2>Gut test</h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1938/1*UnH6XREUH9p-GXHlwkRa2g.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1952/1*C2X7Snqgo65xuk_ciI247A.png\"></p><p>Playful approach (left) and Imagery approach (right)</p><p>The first steps of the UI design process following research included conducting the gut test.</p><p>The gut test is a technique that was presented to our client in order to determine his aesthetic preferences and give our UI team a better idea for the visual design direction. We presented 20 varying images in terms of visual design and presented them to our client to gauge his gut reaction to each option, and rate them on a scale of 1 (do not like) to 5 (love).</p><p>We asked our client Daniel to pay attention to the visual aspects of each design including color, shapes, icons, typefaces, and general composition and told him not to focus so much on the content of the app. From the gut test that we performed, two favorite approaches were selected, which were the playful, fun, vivid approach, and the approach with a large focus on imagery.</p><h2>Design Inception sheet</h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*z_4FhJEoWTQBAyFFphcyAA.png\"></p><p>Design Inception sheet visual</p><p>The next step in the UI design process was creating our design inception sheets. The design inception sheet is great for designers to use as it helps to set a solid base for the design. It consists of a “Why” or reasoning behind our project which sets a basis for all of our design decisions. The design inception sheet also includes the mood and visual language (shape, space, movement, color) for a specific design direction which stems from our “Why”, and is great for reference when making a certain design decision.</p><p>For our design inception sheets, we created three different directions that stemmed from the same “Why”. This is because each of our design directions differed in terms of mood and visual language. The “Why” became:</p><blockquote><em>“To promote the growth of interconnection through insight and understanding of the pattern language”</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Our “Why” is based on the idea of Pattern Language which was created by architect Christopher Alexander and is defined as,</p><p><em>“an attempt to express the deeper wisdom of what brings aliveness within a particular field of human endeavor, through a set of interconnected expressions arising from that wisdom.”</em></p><p>This info was obtained from the Group Works website at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://groupworksdeck.org/pattern-language\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a>&nbsp;on the Group Works website.</p><h1>Our three directions</h1><p>After creating our “Why”, we went three different directions in terms of the mood and visual language using the results from our gut test and the information obtained from our initial client kickoff meeting. We also kept our persona in mind throughout this process.</p><p><br></p><p>Using the gut test results, we decided to go a playful direction as well as a more muted, professional direction, both with a large focus on imagery. We also decided to go a direction with a minimalist approach with more delicate pastel colors to give our client a variety of options to choose from and give him the option to choose different elements that he liked from each direction.</p><p>Daniel did choose elements from each direction and from there we combined them to create the final design, which will be explained later.</p><h1>The Muted Direction</h1><h2><strong>Muted Moodboard</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*c7Wq_58QAegr_wJ6-pxvSA.png\"></p><p>Muted Moodboard</p><p>The first direction that our team decided to go was the muted direction. It has a very muted and professional feel with a focus on human connection, and the mood conveyed through the moodboard is:</p><blockquote><em>Wise, Positive, Evolving, Human Connection</em></blockquote><p><br></p><h2><strong>Muted Style Tile</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*r-WclGdmnNYf4YrD2KJbFg.png\"></p><p>Muted Style Tile</p><p>The visual language elements of the inception sheet are portrayed through our style tiles.</p><p><strong>Visual Language:</strong></p><blockquote><strong><em>Shape</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— Angular</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Space</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— Open</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Movement&nbsp;</em></strong><em>— smooth, direct</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Color</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— Solid, muted, natural</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Category icons</strong>&nbsp;— Muted colors, natural and professional</li><li><strong>App icons</strong>&nbsp;— simple lines with little quirks like open connections</li><li><strong>Colors</strong>&nbsp;— Muted colors, natural and professional</li><li><strong>Typeface</strong>&nbsp;— Radley, which is the font used in the original cards but the regular version for readability, Lato for clear readability</li></ul><h1>The Minimalist Direction</h1><h2><strong>Minimalist Moodboard</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*YyRIVhYQxe4c0S9LRKiuTw.png\"></p><p>Minimalist Moodboard</p><p>The second direction that our team decided to go was the minimalist direction. It has a more delicate pastel approach with a key focus on collaboration. The mood conveyed through this moodboard is:</p><blockquote><em>Wise, Present, Evolving, Calm, Mindful, Productive</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Simple in form</em></blockquote><h2><strong>Minimalist Style Tile</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*WgzpAu2pjGbOql42J_Dy_Q.png\"></p><p>Minimalist Style Tile</p><p><strong>Visual Language:</strong></p><blockquote><strong><em>Shape</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— basic, softened</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Space</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— open, bare, sparse</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Movement —&nbsp;</em></strong><em>hurried, static</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Color —&nbsp;</em></strong><em>transluscent</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Category icons</strong>&nbsp;— pastel, muted, delicate colors</li><li><strong>App icons</strong>&nbsp;— professional, straightforward</li><li><strong>Typeface</strong>&nbsp;— Futura (header) — geometric — resembling circular pattern, simple but friendly and Proxima Nova (copy) for professionalism and legibility</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong>&nbsp;— only slightly rounded corners to focus on efficiency and professionalism, translucent, muted, overlay, monotone</li></ul><h1>The Playful Direction</h1><h2><strong>Playful Moodboard</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*1jgWjNYkk8vpo37Oj4R73Q.png\"></p><p>Playful Moodboard</p><p>The third Direction has a fun and playful approach with a sense of curiosity and childish mood while remaining simple and clean. The mood that this moodboard is conveying is:</p><blockquote><em>Wise, Positive, Curious, Playful, Evolving, Communication</em></blockquote><p><br></p><h2><strong>Playful Style Tile</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Y50sh7SimZvc7Ml3GswVtg.png\"></p><p>Playful Style Tile</p><p><strong>Visual Language:</strong></p><blockquote><strong><em>Shape</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— Rounded, freeform, waves</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Space</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— Open, free, white space</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Movement&nbsp;</em></strong><em>— Gentle, steady, free-flowing</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Color</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— Rainbow, bright, vivid, gradient</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Category icons</strong>&nbsp;— slight gradient for depth and modern feel, rainbow, rounded shapes</li><li><strong>App icons</strong>&nbsp;— playful, rounded corners w/ rounded shapes (playful, inviting, interactive, consistent)</li><li><strong>Colors</strong>&nbsp;— Vivid &amp; bright (playfulness), gradient, rainbow on physical cards</li><li><strong>Typeface</strong>&nbsp;— Playfair Display (header) and Circe (body) — playful yet legible and professional</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong>&nbsp;— Rounded corners for consistency, bright vivid colors to stand out as CTA</li></ul><h1>Final Direction</h1><h2>Style Tile</h2><p>The final style tile that we created before continuing into the skinning, or implementing of the visual design aspects into the mid-fi wireframes, is below. We combined different elements from each of our style tiles based on the preference of our client through the gut test, as well as keeping our target audience and user persona in mind to create an app that is user-focused and highly accessible.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*VXlKyre7iazwlBCHAgXVFg.png\"></p><p>Final Style Tile</p><p>Visual language:</p><blockquote><strong><em>Shape</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— Rounded, gentle, smooth</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Space</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— Open, free, spacious, white space</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Movement&nbsp;</em></strong><em>— flowing, free, gentle</em></blockquote><blockquote><strong><em>Color</em></strong><em>&nbsp;— vivid, gradient, muted rainbow colours</em></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Category icons</strong>&nbsp;— slight gradient for depth and modern feel, muted rainbow, rounded shapes for playfulness</li><li><strong>App icons</strong>&nbsp;— playful, rounded corners with rounded shapes (playful, inviting, interactive, consistent)</li><li><strong>Colors</strong>&nbsp;— muted rainbow colors to stay true to physical cards &amp; not overpowering, rainbow gradient</li><li><strong>Typeface</strong>&nbsp;— Playfair Display (header) and Catamaran (copy), Playful yet legible and professional, easy readability for mobile</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong>&nbsp;— rounded corners for consistency, bright yet muted green to stand out as CTA (banging rocks inspired)</li></ul><p>During the creation of our final style tile and throughout the entire process, we worked on our logo design and finalized the design of the logo around the same time as completing the final style tile. I will do a walk through the process of the logo design in the next section.</p><h1>Logo</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*1OefNehSw9G1xqEnd4SZLA.png\"></p><p>1st Step — Initial Sketches</p><p><strong>1st Step — Initial sketches:&nbsp;</strong>For the logo design of Eurika, we initially sketched out our rough ideas on a sheet of paper and drew as many options as possible to broaden our range. We kept in mind keywords such as&nbsp;<strong>collaboration</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>teamwork</strong>&nbsp;to brainstorm ideas. The first step is pictured above.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*v_cb0voZACLLirGceO2w6g.png\"></p><p>2nd Step — Narrowing it Down</p><p><strong>2nd Step — Narrowing it Down:&nbsp;</strong>The second step of our logo design consisted of selecting three logos as a team, that we felt most suited the company/project as a whole and resonated with the branding. The three options we choose all included the general concept of collaboration represented in different visual forms. The three options chosen are pictured above.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*i3EWxmH7Q8qYHLDtWUw7Ww.png\"></p><p>3rd Step — Logo Evolution</p><p><strong>3rd Step — Logo Evolution:&nbsp;</strong>The third step in our logo design process was to digitize our three options in black and white on adobe illustrator and present them to the client. After an option was chosen by the client, we adjusted and experimented with the base shape of the logo to make it more lively, appealing, and suiting to the company’s branding. The chosen option is pictured above on the left, along with the evolution of the logo.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/932/1*R4CXuj2xsX0D7RMdeWozBA.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/817/1*1YJhUyv7jTTzp-VzS930_g.gif\"></p><p>4th Step — Finalizing</p><p><strong>4th Step — Finalizing:&nbsp;</strong>The fourth and final step in our logo design process was finalizing the logo design and presenting it to our client alongside the high fidelity prototype and presentation of the design process. The final logo design consists of a group of four people in a card shape format representing the cards in the physical deck. This represents the idea of collaboration and communication. The rainbow color scheme is staying true to the roots of the physical cards and the color of the pattern icons. The rainbow colors are a gradient across the logo to represent unity and growth/evolution of working together as a team!</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*rVl7gnqqrNEeHTEVWaaKRg.gif\"></p><p>Logo Animation</p><h1>Hi-Fidelity Screens/Final Prototype</h1><p>For the final Hi-Fi screens, our team created an InVision prototype walkthrough, as well as a Principle prototype for presentation. I will link the InVision prototype below.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*jW4Wn5RkCpyG9n0a8xtOBA.png\"></p><p>Hi-Fi Wireframes Part 1</p><p>The first four screens of the example wireframes consist of the patterns/categories page, the pattern card, a card within a pattern, as well as a collection example.</p><p>When a user first opens the app, they briefly presented with a splash/loading screen, followed by the main page called “Patterns”. It consists of the 9 card patterns or categories within the deck and when tapped, the user will be navigated to the pattern card page.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*OvqBHAOchlpSkZYaeB6dNQ.png\"></p><p>Pattern card (left) and selected card (right)</p><p>The pattern card (intention in this case) page consists of an explanation of the card and when a user scrolls down they can view the cards within the pattern (pictured above). There is also a share and add to collection option on the top right for the pattern card where a user can share cards via email, or add their own set collections within the app. This is great if a user wants to use a specific collection for a meeting, debrief, etc. When a card is selected, the user will transition to the selected card.</p><p>A selected card (commitment in this case) has a brief explanation, along with a share and add to collection option. As the user scrolls down they have a list of related cards which was derived from the physical card deck (pictured above along with pattern card).</p><p>I will explain the example collection screen (co-op housing workshop) in the next section along with the following example wireframes.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*YbDkl593UrNS8avcCeI1uw.png\"></p><p>Hi-Fi Wireframes Part 2</p><p>The following wireframes (above) include a cards screen, collections screen, and an overlay example.</p><p>When a card is added using the add to collection button on a specific card, a screen would appear prompting the user to choose a collection to add the card to. After the process, the user’s action would be confirmed with a checkmark (right) and they can go to the collection using the CTA on this overlay.</p><p>After a user goes to the given collection, they can view the cards within that specific collection (co-op housing workshop) which can also be navigated to through the collection screen (middle screen).</p><p>The cards screen (left) is an index where users can view all the cards alphabetically or can navigate through the 91 cards in the deck easily by using the alphabetical sorting options on this screen. The search bar is also an additional feature for quickly searching for a specific card.</p><h2>Invision Prototype</h2><p>Please enjoy viewing the InVision prototype below!</p><h2><a href=\"https://invis.io/TQS4ZEC3B6M#/363627820_Page_-_Committment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to view the project `Group Works Hi-Fi`</a></h2><p><a href=\"https://invis.io/TQS4ZEC3B6M#/363627820_Page_-_Committment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This prototype brought to you by InVisionApp</a></p><p><a href=\"https://invis.io/TQS4ZEC3B6M#/363627820_Page_-_Committment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">invis.io</a></p><p><br></p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This project was very valuable to myself and I enjoyed working with a team of individuals to create a product for a community client. Our client Daniel was an absolute pleasure to work with and was very helpful every step of the way in providing the team with what we required or anything additional that we needed.</p><p><br></p><p>It was a great learning experience and our team grew and actively learned together, and from each other. We were also able to effectively adapt to the situations or roadblocks that we experienced in a timely and collaborative manner. We worked extremely well as a team and am very thankful for my team members. I learned a lot from them and from RED academy in general through this project, especially the instructors.</p><p>As for future considerations, there were a few in terms of UX, but I think that a takeaway for the UI team would be to have a better understanding of each other’s viewpoints and being more communicative about certain topics. All in all, we grew and learned from this as we worked through the project.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read and supporting our work!</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*uwQ3XafCa8lHCFcsn1NCSQ.png\"></p>",

      "body": "<p>I recently offered to talk at the local primary school, about my job (or at least part of my job). I expected to be speaking to the older kids, and be able to talk specifically about the cool parts of the job, and maybe some of the sucky bits too, and how you get around them. However, I was asked to talk to a reception class (four and five-year-olds), and it turned out to be an interesting exercise in boiling down what you do, to its most basic elements.</p><p>Firstly, I couldn’t rest on my laurels and rely on some of the brands I’ve worked with, to win me any kudos, like it might with the older kids —<em>&nbsp;“Yeah, I’ve worked for Channel 4, and the BBC, and Diesel, and the BRIT Awards, and I even&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.afieldinengland.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>designed a website</em></a><em>&nbsp;that got me an&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0899273/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>imdb entry</em></a><em>&nbsp;(even though I share same entry with some dude who was in Xena: Warrior Princess). Whatevs…”</em>&nbsp;That doesn’t fly with reception age kids. So I really needed to explain, in the simplest possible terms, what I did, and why it’s important.</p><h1>So what do I actually do?</h1><p>I thought it’d be a good idea to explain what design in all its forms is. I’ve long held the notion that all forms of design are effectively about communication, be that user experience design, industrial design, fashion design, but that’s a pretty lofty thing to explain to kids. I ended up with:</p><p><br></p><blockquote>Design is about making something easy to use, or easy to understand.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>That seemed about right. I then explained there were all different types of designer — building designers (who decide how big to make the rooms, and where to put doors and windows), book designers (who make the books you read fun and interesting), game designers (who decide how to make Angry Birds fun, and where to put the buttons) and furniture designers (who decide what size to make chairs, and how to make them comfortable).</p><p>I also pointed out that toilet design is really important. We all use toilets every day, and they need to be the right size, and comfortable to sit on, and you need to be able to reach the paper. Cue lots of giggles and muttering of the word ‘toilet’. Want to get 4-year-olds on-side? Talk about toilets.</p><p>We then did a yes/no shouting-out exercise, about things that have been designed, and things that havent. My list:</p><blockquote>– a puddle (“noooooo!”)</blockquote><blockquote>– a book (“yessssss!”)</blockquote><blockquote>– a squirrel (“noooooo!”)</blockquote><blockquote>– a car (“yessssss!”)</blockquote><blockquote>…and so on.</blockquote><p>So now the kids knew what design was about, I had to explain what graphic design was. Again, how do I do this so it’s easy to understand? After some searching, I hit upon:</p><blockquote>I use colours, letters and pictures to help people understand things.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>Phew. After an entire career of batting away comments about ‘colouring in’, and ‘making things look nice’, I finally hit upon something that is so much clearer than spluttering, ‘it’s a lot more than that, y’know’, and stomping off in a huff. I might even put it on my business card.</p><p>So I started by asking the class of (surprisingly well-behaved) children which one was the hot tap.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/564/1*h-aaZmNuO_LnZxpCfP9WsA.jpeg\"></p><p>After a child successfully said ‘red’, I asked them&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;we think that red means ‘hot’. What can you think of that’s red, that is hot?</p><p>“Fire”</p><p>“The Sun”</p><p>“Lava”</p><p>– some great answers for the kids. So we use red to mean ‘hot’, because it makes us think of hot things.</p><p>Same with blue. What’s blue and cold?</p><p>“Ice”</p><p>– yes, ice can sometimes look blue. It feels cold. That’s why Elsa’s dress in&nbsp;<em>Frozen</em>&nbsp;is blue, isn’t it?</p><h1>Activity time</h1><p>I’m a dad of two, so I know kids of this age won’t sit still for too long. It was time to break things up with an activity. My partner (a primary school teacher) made some little colour swatch books to hand out, and ask the class to choose colours based on questions.</p><p><br></p><p><em>– Pick a colour that reminds you of night time.</em></p><p><em>– Pick a colour that makes you think of fruit.</em></p><p><em>– Pick a colour that reminds you of The Gruffalo!</em></p><p>That last one got a great response — the majority chose brown, but some smart kids chose orange (for his eyes), black (for his tongue) and purple (for his prickles). This showed the kids how there’s often more than one answer to a design question, and how colour can help you feel things.</p><p>We then did another activity, where I gave the kids a sheet of words to colour in. This gave them the chance to put what they’d learned so far into practice. The results were great. Lots of red for the word ‘angry’, alternating bright colours for ‘sweets’, green for ‘grass’.</p><p>We then talked about why children had chosen their colours, and got some very cogent answers. Of course, there was sometimes people had chosen a colour ‘because I like it’, which is valid too.</p><h1>Typography</h1><p>So, we’d covered colour, and the other thing I wanted to talk about was words. I talked about how signs tell us important things, and the words need to be easy to read. I showed them a simple sign, and asked them what I could do to the letters, to make the sign better. “Make them bigger” came the answer, so I showed them a second sign, which we all agreed is better because it makes the word more important, and you can see it from further away.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*slH99CVXdki7utRana44gw.png\"></p><p>I then talked about how you can do things to letters and words, to help tell stories. We talked about Lauren Child’s excellent&nbsp;<em>Charlie &amp; Lola</em>&nbsp;books, and how the words go all over the place, to make the stories interesting, and make the words feel like what they’re saying. I showed them a simple sentence, which we all read out together:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*hJZbo5Xbnxef_sugsgZimg.png\"></p><p>Then I showed them the same sentence, for us to read out again:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*LFVhEip2sUze6l_9DbGYiQ.png\"></p><p>See how changing the size of the word ‘big’, makes the sentence more exciting? It makes you say that word differently than the last time, and makes you wonder just how big this dog is.</p><p>I also showed how you could make a series of changes to a simple word, again to help you feel the meaning more. I showed the below iterations one at a time:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*yOddPcFpWwX7miGOFayVIA.png\"></p><p>Each time, the kids agreed the word felt faster than the last.</p><p>By this point we were running out of time, which was a shame, as I wanted to get them ‘designing’ a word, using interesting combinations of colours and some visual tricks (for example, the simple word ‘holiday’ using things that make them feel like holidays).</p><p>I was surprised by two things: how readily most of the kids understood what design was for, and how they can express things through it; and also, for someone who specialises in explaining things to a target audience, how it took me doing a talk to children, to force me to confront my own profession, and explain its value in clear terms.</p><p>A week later, I was delighted to be sent a pile of work from a lesson the teacher had set, around the themes we touched on. Many of the kids really got it.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*yuPCrnG7qN-WlB4ok7y7Zg.jpeg\"></p>",

Today we’re going straight into a major struggle for most designers which is how to get our first logo design client. Every one of us has faced this in our careers so it’s definitely worth discussing.</p><p>My first ever logo design was for my course-mate (<em>let’s call her Sharon</em>) who ran a makeup business back in the University. She had a couple of customers and she wanted to brand herself to look more professional and possibly attract even more customers so she contacted me.</p><p>But let’s forget about the project itself. What did I actually do for her to contact me to design a logo?</p><p>At the time (2019), I started getting active on social media — Instagram to be precise. I shared a couple of posters and random designs on my page and I began to get some attention from some of my friends. In my department (Petroleum Engineering), I also volunteered to work on flyers that were used to advertise upcoming technical lectures and events. These steps helped me build a small design network with my friends because I was one of the few people they knew that was into graphic design.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ARPhmZFpGw-rcov23w3HNw.png\"></p><p>Some posters I designed in 2019</p><p>Sharon mentioned that she had seen a couple of my designs and wanted me to work on a logo for her business. What was even more interesting was at the time, I had not designed any logo before. After the project, I asked her why she contacted me and she pointed out how she saw some of my previous works and decided that I should be able to design logos.</p><blockquote><em>Wow! It was then I realized the power of sharing your work.</em></blockquote><p><br></p><p>Sharing your work shows your friends and family your ideas and your approach to design. I say friends and family because you might not really have an audience when you’re starting out and people in your circle usually turn out to be one of your first clients. Make sure you are putting out your designs on social media and who knows, your first client might just be around the corner. I recommend that you start with one platform (e.g. Instagram), before expanding to others like Behance, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook so it doesn’t feel too overwhelming at the beginning.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*RrSB1Z5tTd7bUPk6vjdIhQ.png\"></p><p>Emmanuel Akpan — Share your work</p><p>In addition, get prepared to have your first client. Even before you are reached out to, start practicing how to make logos. Learn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSxg87CoOu4&amp;t=303s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">how to present logos</a>&nbsp;to clients and also how to charge for logo design projects. Get up to speed even so the whole process doesn’t seem so new when the client actually comes in. There are lots of resources on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcJtrfTBF_M&amp;list=PL-c9Rq56P4Kk3IyPlXkZAqGH14iNHz1S9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>&nbsp;to guide you with the entire logo design process.</p><p>I really believe if you can start practicing the nitty-gritty of logo design and share your current work, no matter how bad you think it is, you’ll be having your first client in no time. I’m rooting for you.</p><h1><strong>Design resource of the week</strong></h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*pxUB8pzXOk17cg12Lyu4kw.png\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.ls.graphics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">.LS Graphics</a>&nbsp;is a website that offers exclusive and free mockups for your presentations and UI tools.

The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term “graphic design” is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images, and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to create visual compositions.</p><h1>Types of Graphic Design</h1><p>There are many different types of graphic design, but the most common ones are logo design, web design, print design, and illustration.</p><p><br></p><h1>Some other common types of graphic design include:</h1><p><strong>Logo design:&nbsp;</strong>This is the creation of a company’s logo, which is often one of the first things people see when looking at a website or product.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Web design:</strong>&nbsp;This includes the design and construction of a website and the layout and graphics used on it.</p><p><strong>Print design</strong>&nbsp;includes everything from creating flyers and brochures to advertising and marketing materials.</p><p><strong>Icon design:&nbsp;</strong>Icons are often used on websites and other digital materials to help identify specific elements or features.</p><p><strong>Illustration:</strong>&nbsp;Illustration can be used to add a unique and striking visual element to any design project.</p><p><strong>Animation:&nbsp;</strong>Animation can be used to create stylish and eye-catching motion graphics.</p><p><strong>Visual communication</strong>&nbsp;includes creating effective infographics to designing compelling logos and branding.</p><h1>Principles of Graphic Design</h1><p>In this blog post, we will explore graphic design principles. Graphic design is a process of creating compelling visuals for communication. It has been described as the “creation of visual messages that appeal to an audience”. Graphic designers must have a strong understanding of typography, layout, color, and image composition to create compelling visuals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>There are five fundamental principles of graphic design:</strong></p><p>1. Organization — Graphic designers should organize their work so that the images convey a message effectively. They should place images in a practical order and use layout to improve readability.</p><p>2. Typography — Good typography can add impact and style to your visuals. When designing visuals, you should consider the typeface, size, position, and other factors.</p><p>3. Color — Colors can help make your visuals more appealing or stimulate a particular mood. Use different colors to represent other elements in your design.</p><p>4. Image Composition — Images should be arranged to create an effective composition. You should consider your images’ size, placement, and lighting when composing them.</p><p>5. Technique — You can use many techniques to improve your visuals. It would help to experiment with different techniques to see what works best for your images.</p><h1>The Elements of Graphic Design</h1><p>There are many different types of graphic design, but all share some common elements. These include layout, typography, images, and color.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Layout</strong></p><p>The layout is the arrangement of elements on a page. It includes the size and position of text and graphics, as well as the use of margins, borders, and headers. The layout can be simple or complex and can be used to create a unified look for a website or project.</p><p><strong>Typography</strong></p><p>Typography is the selection and use of typefaces to create readable text. Typefaces can be classic or contemporary, large or small, lightweight or heavy. They can also have a variety of styles, including modern, traditional, and vintage. Typography can help to establish a visual style for a project or website and can be used to create emphasis or contrast within a layout.</p><p><strong>Images</strong></p><p>Images are an essential part of any graphic design project. They can be used to create an impressionistic or realistic look for a project, or they can be used to convey a specific message or idea. Images can be added to layouts, text blocks, and other elements to create a cohesive visual impact.</p><p><strong>Color</strong></p><p>Color is an essential element of graphic design. It can be used to create a sense of warmth or coolness, accentuate specific layout elements, or communicate a particular message or idea. Color can be used to add personality to a project and can help to create a cohesive visual impact.</p><h1>Approaches to Graphic Design</h1><p>Graphics and design have come a long way, from the days of hand-drawn sketches to intricately designed logos. Graphic design has evolved into an ever-growing and complex field that requires different types of approaches to create compelling and appealing visuals.</p><p><br></p><h1>Here are four different types of graphic design:</h1><p><strong>Poster Design:</strong>&nbsp;This design creates striking and eye-catching visuals for exhibitions, posters, or advertisements. They can be very modern or retro in style, with bold colors and intricate details. One common approach is to use typography as the primary tool for creating contrast and emphasis.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Web Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Web graphics are used to create attractive and user-friendly websites. They can be used to create backgrounds, buttons, logos, or any other type of graphical element. Because millions of people see web graphics daily, they need to be stylish and functional.</p><p><strong>UI/UX Design:</strong>&nbsp;User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design are concerned with how users interact with a product or service. It includes everything from the look and feel of a website or application to the interactions between users and the system itself. UI/UX designers must deeply understand technology and user behavior to create compelling designs.</p><p><strong>Print Design:</strong>&nbsp;Print design creates stunning visuals for magazines, books, and other printed materials. They can be modern or traditional in style, with bold colors and intricate details. Some common approaches include using typography and imagery to create striking images and techniques to create a practical layout.</p><h1>Creative Processes in Graphic Design</h1><p>There are many different creative processes in graphic design, but some of the most common are ideation, sketching, refining, and creating a final product.</p><p><br></p><p>Ideation is when designers come up with new ideas for designs or illustrations. Sketching is when they try out these ideas by drawing them on paper. Refining is when they make the sketches look better and test different ideas. Creating a final product is when they combine all of their ideas and create a finished design or illustration.</p><p>Some other standard creative processes are storyboarding, wireframing, prototyping, and user experience design. These processes help designers figure out how an idea will work before they start creating the layout. They also help them figure out how people will use the design and what changes need to be made.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>We have explored the different types of graphic design and given you some tips on developing your skills in that area. From logo design to web design, from typography to photography, a lot goes into making a great-looking piece of work. So if you’re interested in getting into graphic design, now is the time to start learning!</p>",

Therefore, I decided to talk about it, as well as provide code that you can test yourself. Some questions can be answered at the end of the article.</p><h2>What is text inversion?</h2><p>I will try to explain it in a more understandable language.</p><p><br></p><p>Text inversion allows you to train a model of a new \"concept\" that you can associate with a \"word\" without changing the weights, instead fine-tuning the text embedding vectors.</p><p>So, for example, I added a bunch of photos of a plush penguin. I was then able to ask the model to, for example, create a drawing of my particular plush penguin. Or generate a photo of my particular plush penguin sitting on top of a mountain. The goal is to allow you to import a specific idea/concept from photographs/images that were not generated by the model and learn how to represent them. It can also be used to represent styles. So let's say you've uploaded a bunch of drawings by a certain artist, then you can ask them to generate images in that particular style.</p><h2>Using text inversion</h2><p>Now I will show how you can train Stable Diffusion with text inversion. This code can also be found in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/textual_inversion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">github repository</a>&nbsp;or use this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_textual_inversion_training.ipynb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">colab</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Before starting work, I advise you to register with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">HuggingFace</a>&nbsp;and get an access token with the \"write\" access setting. Now you can get started.</p><p>In a colab, the code is located in cells that can be run individually, but I will try to explain the main points that often cause problems.</p><ul><li>First you need to install the necessary libraries and go to HuggingFace. For this, we need an access token. Signing into HuggingFace will allow you to save your trained model and share it with the Stable Diffusion content library if needed.</li><li>In the \"Settings for teaching your new concept\" section, you must select a checkpoint on which all training will be tied. By default, there is a checkpoint \"CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\". You can specify any other.</li><li>Next, work with the dataset begins. The official text inversion colab allows you to use direct links to images, but for my project with the inheritance of the style of the artist Ilya Kuvshinov, I used Google disk on which I have about 1000 images of art by this artist (I used only 30 images). To do this, I logged into my colab account and using the shutil module copied the folder from my Google drive:</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><ul><li>Next, I had to slightly modify the code so that the model could use my images:</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><ul><li>Now we can move on to setting up the model. In the \"what_to_teach\" section, you can choose an object (allows you to teach the model new objects) or a style (as in my case, the style of the artist’s images). In the \"placeholder_token\" section, you must specify a name by which you can later use it on the trained model. I have this &lt;kuvshinov-style&gt;. In the \"initializer_token\" section, you must specify 1 word that will show what your model is about. I have this kuvshinov.</li><li>Now we can start training the model. To do this, simply run the cells found in this section \"Teach the model a new concept (fine-tuning with textual inversion)\". You can also see what parameters are used there and if you are interested, even edit them. Sometimes, during the launch of the cells in this section, an error may occur in which the code swears at the wrong initializer_token. Most often, this error is thrown by one and also a cell, so you can comment out an unnecessary piece of code like mine. The name of this cell is \"Get token ids for our placeholder and initializer token. This code block will complain if initializer string is not a single token\". After that, you can continue to run the code</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><ul><li>Model training takes an average of +/- 3 hours. After that, you can test the resulting model and publish it to the Stable Diffusion Content Library</li><li>In order to test and publish the model, you need to go to the \"Run the code with your newly trained model\" section. In the \"Save your newly created concept to the library of concepts\" box, you can specify the name of your concept, as well as choose whether to publish the model or not. If you decide to publish it, then in the hf_token_write line you must specify the access token that you specified above when entering HuggingFace. Be sure to check what access this token has. There are only 2 of them: reading and writing (write). We need a write token.</li><li>После этого вы можете запустить все остальные ячейки поочередно. В последней ячейке в строке prompt необходимо указать вашу текстовую подсказку на английском языке и указать ваш placeholder_token. На пример: a grafitti in a wall with a &lt;kuvshinov-style&gt; on it</li></ul><h2>Question and answer</h2><ul><li>How many resources are required to train the model?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>To train my model, I used 30 1024x1024 images, but you can also use fewer images. The developers of this technology for their tests chose from 3 to 5 images.</p><ul><li>Does the learning rate depend on the size of the dataset?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>No, it doesn’t. I tried using both 5 and 30 images and on average the learning rate remained the same.</p><ul><li>\"To save this concept for reuse, download the learned_embeds.bin file or save it to the concept library.\" Does this mean I can use this on my local diffusion stable that I'm already running? How do I do this, where will this .bin file go, and how do I tell the program to use it?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Yes, you can run your model on your local computer, but you need to make sure you have enough video memory, because at the heart of all this is the Stable Diffusion model which requires 8 GB of video memory. To see how it works use this&nbsp;</p><p>c<a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_conceptualizer_inference.ipynb\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">olab</a></p><p>.</p><ul><li>Can this be used to add more/new pop culture stuff to have better results for stuff that needs more data in the existing set, and also to add new stuff that isn't in the dataset so SD can output data on the specified things?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Yes. You can.</p><p>Thank you for reading this article. This is my first post so don’t judge too harshly. If you want to read more about this, check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">diffusers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">notebook</a>&nbsp;github.

      "body": "<p>UX trends have seen a particularly drastic shift in 2022. As devices become more powerful, working memories increase, screens become more pixel-dense, and connection speeds faster, it is only natural that UX trends evolve with the times. At the forefront of shaping these trends are cutting-edge tech companies with their bloated roster of UX researchers and designers.</p><p>This post will explore the top seven UX trends influencing the user experience design world in 2022.</p><h1>1. Extended Reality (ER)</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*L10wHq8KLqxfZv-kLiE8qQ.png\"></p><p>We already know that new as they are, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have stagnated as far as getting incorporated into everyday designs go. The adoption of Extended Reality (ER), on the other hand, is at an all-time high in 2022.</p><p>Companies like Adidas, McDonald’s, Ikea, and Instagram are integrating ER in their internal training and interaction software. This new trend is proving invaluable in helping employees learn using realistic simulations. Users can ‘try on’ products in a virtual environment and connect to real people to communicate, for entertainment, and in games.</p><p>So, what exactly is ER in UX design?</p><p>ER encompasses multiple concepts of virtual interactions. These include AR and VR. As developers push the boundaries of what is possible in the virtual world, designers are tasked with developing better and more realistic interactions. ER is special as it incorporates the latest interaction technologies, including holographic displays, spatial and audio augmentation, and tactile feedback.</p><p>Mixed reality researchers and developer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Fundamentals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WebXR</a>&nbsp;take the credit for leading the push into ER for traditional apps and games. As AR, VR, and 3D become more mainstream, more designers are finding ER the best design approach for all the platforms.</p><h1>2. Scrollytelling</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*vUTMoUhRO-JyH2w4uu4u7A.gif\"></p><p>In a world dealing with social media addiction and other problems, the word ‘scrolling’ has become synonymous with mindless boredom. UX researchers know this and have developed something new and better to replace scrolling: scrollytelling.</p><p>Scrollytelling, as you can tell, contains part scrolling and part telling a story. This new kind of narrative can be presented within an app and on a web page.</p><p>Scrollytelling is implemented by making each illustration, text, font, and any other element on the page come to life with each scroll. Much like in a parallax video game, scrollytelling is presented as a maze of symbols and styles that takes the boredom out of scrolling. This makes the user an active participant in manipulating the events on the screen rather than just a mere consumer.</p><p>The popularity of scrollytelling is rising, and it is only a matter of time before every interactive website features it. Users are tired of static pages stuffed with content that demands their attention, one-pixel roll after another. Scrollytelling is activated by a scroll and does not require clicks, making endless choices, pop-ups, or aggressive swiping.</p><h1>3. Neo-Brutalism</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/564/1*nHicVG14OK4vNNoggb7nrw.jpeg\"></p><p>Neo-Brutalism Design: Image by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bannersnack.com/graphic-design-trends/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">blog.bannersnack.com</a></p><p>The neo-brutalism UX design is inspired by the 1950s brutalism architecture that produced some of the most striking building designs post-WWII. These designs proved to be both shocking and controversial, largely because of their emphasis on a rugged and unpolished look that almost looked intentionally ugly.</p><p>The neo-brutalism design of websites and apps celebrates the underlying structure and the materials of design. They feature raw, bold, and reactionary features that made the original brutalism design a hit of its time.</p><p>For far too long, the world of UX design has obsessed over and even perfected, the art of clean designs. Conventional websites feature lean and clean elements that make them uniform, even dull. This new design approach turns out to be raw, honest, and with visual experiences that stand out from the crowd.</p><p>Some features that define neo-brutalism include overlapping elements, intense color palettes, and gridless layouts with crowded chaotic elements. Oddly sized and monospace typography, minimal or total lack of navigation give this design its ‘open floor’ design with a brutal and rugged look.</p><h1>4. Inclusivity</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*8T41AzIICwAiO5OoTVEf-g.jpeg\"></p><p>You have probably come across the term inclusivity countless times in marketing. In UX design, inclusivity refers to experiences that cater to all ways people may engage with a website or app. Inclusive UX is different from diverse UX in that it focuses on functionality and ensures that the largest possible audience can find value in their experience effectively.</p><p>While it is more than a trend, inclusivity is becoming a crucial aspect of every UX design. Big tech companies discovered the various forms of inclusivity and put them into practice and now everybody is striving for it. Some notable examples of new inclusive design trends are Twitter’s language identification, Pinterest skin tone selector, and Clue’s non-gender-specific language.</p><p>As the world becomes increasingly globalized and complicated, the spectrum of differences between users becomes more apparent. Inclusivity is a design paradigm that nurtures the empathy designers need to have to design experiences for users across the spectrum of differences. These differences cover languages, cultures, genders, races, sexualities, abilities, and disabilities.</p><h1>5. Data Visualization</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Zp2P7YWITbfdoklD4RT4kw.jpeg\"></p><p>Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@lukechesser?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Luke Chesser</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/Data+visualization?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></p><p>There was a time when users cared little about data; they only paid attention to what the data implied. Today, however, thanks to the enlightenment of users and the proliferation of fake news and skewed facts, users care more about data than ever before. For this reason, there is an evolution in how companies present data and information about them.</p><p>New data visualization methods are useful in conveying data and information about the data in a simple and engaging way. UX design is as much about presenting data as helping the user make a quick informed decision about complex datasets.</p><p>The new emerging ways to visualize data include video infographics, real-time data graphing, leveraging color gradients and transitions, interactive visualizations, and responsive mobile-friendly visualizations. These data visualization strategies also serve to attract and retain the user’s attention with visually entertaining elements- especially when the data is extensive or datasets complex.</p><p>People get tired of reading data that demands attention to understand and interpret. Consequently, designers are using these new design methods to make data pop up, but in less dramatic ways. Some of the most frequently visualized data types today include scatterplots, maps, bar and radar charts, and line and area charts.</p><h1>6. Immersive Animation</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Hpt6hyQLGogtR2vRFOi13g.gif\"></p><p>Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dribbble.com/GregoryVillien\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gregory Villien</a></p><p>Animations have been around for as long as art has existed. Today, more companies are using animation on apps and websites for a lot more than making elements look good. They also use them to make content more fun and interesting and improve user immersion and experience.</p><p>Traditional animations are becoming blander with time. The new style of mixed animation that combines 2D and 3D elements with stop-motion has become very popular. Designers use graphics and physics-based animations to produce unusually-styled solutions that generally manipulate user psychology to improve the overall quality of the interaction.</p><p>In 2022, immersive animation plays a role in design that regular animation has not before: product branding. Companies invest millions to produce unique animations that improve their brand’s animated identity. These animations add character to content, including text and images, and complement brand voice and tone.</p><p>As new facets of animations emerge, UX designers are jostling to set the trend in using animations to make a story anywhere on the screen and to make the loading and error page more entertaining. Captivating cursor effects that were insanely popular in the early 2000s are back with a bang. Immersive animations are also used to make explainer videos more captivating and make kinetic typography more fashionable.</p><h1>7. Microinteractions</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*bdQmprf2uS66L6LwM4pj0g.gif\"></p><p>Microinteractions refer to the small interface and feedback changes that assist the user to navigate an app or website. They often include visual, audio, and kinetic effects that serve as feedback or prompts for the user. They are built into apps and websites to inform users what happened, prompt them to take action, or suggest what comes next.</p><p>Microinteractions are not new; they have been around for over three decades. However, these UX effects are getting a new lease of life, especially when combined with immersive interactions such as animations. Designers now use microinteractions to keep users engaged and develop a positive user experience.</p><p>One key aspect of modern microinteractions is how harmonious they are with other elements of UI and UX. For instance, using splash colors to complement animated data is a noticeable tactic to keep the user’s attention from scattering. Microinteractions play a key role in adding meaning to the various elements on a device screen.</p><p>UX Designers in top tech companies use barely noticeable but psychologically impactive microtransactions in various ways. For starters, they are useful in helping navigate a website or app, explaining various functionalities, and even introducing new elements. Processes that were previously lengthy and dull are now ‘gamified’ through microinteractions that help the user perceive information better.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Digital design, and especially user experience, is a constantly evolving art. Every new emerging and re-emerging trend serves a new purpose and often helps the user in a myriad of ways. However, despite all the developments and trends, the role of design remains the same. When I design and build an app, I cannot afford to overlook any new trends set by top tech companies.</p>",

      "body": "<p>We all learn from mistakes, and this rule applies to web designers as well. In this article, we will tell you what mistakes many of them make when creating user interface design.</p><p>It can be difficult to follow generally accepted rules in the creative work of a web designer. Indeed, it’s much more convenient to know “how not to do” and be guided by this. That’s why we decided to put together a list of the worst mistakes in UI design.</p><h1>UI Blunders: Please, Don’t Do This</h1><p>Wanna know what mistakes even experienced UI designers make? Then welcome to our top 10!</p><p><br></p><h2>#1 — Grey text on colored backgrounds</h2><p>Each of us has experience using web applications and visiting websites in open areas, under direct sunlight. And everything would be fine if the contrast of the font with the background allowed us to recognize words and numbers. However, most webmasters forget about these nuances for some reason. As a result, mobile users are forced to cover the screen with their hands or go into the shadows to somehow cope with the situation. Think twice before choosing a solid background for a gray font.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*PAnX7XHfimZCvgmE.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#2 — Filling the whole screen</h2><p>Sometimes little doesn’t mean bad. When some web pages end up with a minimal amount of content, it’s not always wrong — the main thing is to distribute it evenly. Conversely,&nbsp;some webmasters are wary of free space and try to clutter it up by choosing larger fonts and stretching banners and images.&nbsp;It often turns out to be ridiculous. Don’t be like these webmasters, leave some space if there is not much content.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*zWXYX2GrMxswhLvd.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#3 — User-uploaded content</h2><p>It’s not always a good idea to let users of your website upload graphic files to public web pages on their own. There are many reasons for this — from the low resolution of these images to inappropriate content. Therefore, before opening this option for your target audience, take care of the integration of moderation algorithms.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*cYAebKNgKpmejhr2.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#4 — Overloaded style</h2><p>We have already said a lot about the excess of elements on web pages. We will only highlight the need to follow the rule “less is more”, especially when it comes to experimental web design that is built from scratch. Remember that this can not only look unattractive but also confuse users.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*WQHZloq4Qq9gdDcA.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#5 — Bad font</h2><p>Let’s talk about the experimental fonts, that some webmasters use to emphasize the originality of their creations. First, they often “float” on non-standard sized user devices. Secondly, when using a non-unique font, you run the risk of making a pathetic copy-paste of someone else’s design, and all because your work will be recognized by the font. That’s why it’s often better to choose something neutral when it comes to choosing a font.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*DGkF63Zl81Ei9lSJ.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#6 — Uninviting CTAs</h2><p>Another common problem is the blind desire of webmasters to minimize the number of CTA words that they place on buttons and other small format elements. As a result, calls to action look insecure, and everything that is written there turns out to be completely unattractive to users. That’s why it’s sometimes worth considering adding a bit of space and letting content managers get smart when writing CTAs.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*ssxZ6oK4DWLFmExr.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#7 — No social proof</h2><p>Many of us, when choosing products, were led to some kind of laboratory research or customer reviews given as social proof. Do not neglect these “facts” when designing a website that sells them. This will add confidence to potential buyers that they have made the right choice.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*Mv7RyM3CYZ9968lP.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#8 — Too much text</h2><p>Websites with an abundance of text content are one of the unspoken trends of the late nineties when the Internet was in its infancy. In turn, today infographics have replaced this trend, as they can explain the vast majority of complex things in an accessible and understandable way without creating unnecessary trouble for users. That’s why it’s better to look for a designer to create informative images for your website than to force your users to read a lot.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*3N1Eg1Bai-LxZkGS.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#9 — Too complex navigation</h2><p>Difficult navigation is a disadvantage of mostly Asian websites. Honestly, we don’t know why their creators like to confuse their users so much. Therefore, we insist on properly structuring the functionality — so that even those who don’t know the local language can figure out what to do without the help of Google Translate.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*DPKXOSQVqouOqnr-.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h2>#10 — Poor padding and spacing</h2><p>And finally, the worst problem is when web designers don’t bother with proper spacing and padding between interface elements. As a result, even adaptive and responsive layouts may be unusable, as text content on small format devices is so microscopic that it’s impossible to read it without zoom.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*ZCmxhZsx29KlSFUa.jpg\"></p><p>Example taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.refactoringui.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Refactoring UI”</a>&nbsp;by Wathan A. and Schoger S.</p><h1>Final Words</h1><p>Of course, we have not listed all the typical mistakes that webmasters face when creating user interface design. But we hope that our list will save you from the most annoying ones. So, get inspired and — go ahead to achieve new heights in web design!</p>",

Switching careers during a time of global&nbsp;uncertainty&nbsp;is an even bigger challenge. That’s why we continue to be awed by the creativity of our UX Academy graduates who continue to pursue their dreams of a creative career despite the challenges they face.</p><p>As we enter our third calendar year of ambiguity, we are reassured by our student success at companies like Accenture, IBM, Meta, Pinterest, Shopify, and Squarespace. Students continue to transition from roles in education, finance, hospitality, healthcare, and marketing, as well as adjacent professions like fashion, graphic, or other design backgrounds.</p><p>A huge part of the career pivot is a unique UX design portfolio. While we regularly publish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/category/success-stories/?me=%EMAIL%\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">success stories of our students</a>&nbsp;that profile how and why they made their career switch to UX/UI design, we also like to spotlight a few standout portfolio examples.</p><p>With the help of mentors and career coaches, the Designlab community continues to create noteworthy portfolios. Read on to explore a selection of UX/UI design portfolios from Designlab students that are sure to inspire you.</p><h1>10 Great Portfolio Examples from Designlab Students</h1><p>Here are some of our top student portfolios, and insights into what we particularly liked about each. (Portfolios are listed in no particular order.)</p><p><br></p><h1>1. Peter Noah</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*n7w8iYdo2lNq66hDahRKBA@2x.png\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.peternoah.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Noah’s Portfolio</a></p><p>Peter Noah’s portfolio website stands out for many reasons (storytelling, strong UI, variety of work), but his About Me page really sums up his years of experience working in the design field in a straightforward, succinct way.</p><p>Career switchers have a tendency to overshare or digress, but Peter keeps his summary short, sweet, and to the point which is appealing to people who are trying to hire a talented Product Designer who also has a mind for the business of design.</p><h1>2. Josie Allison</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*jwt-QqjPCKazH1aY.jpg\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.itsjosie.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Josie Allison’s Portfolio</a></p><p>We talk about keeping things clean and minimal in design, but sometimes going over the top with visual elements works out. Josie has a background in Graphic Design, and clearly illustrates her ability to surprise and delight in her own portfolio.</p><p>Her unconventional case study presentations challenge the norms, but the details are all there for someone who wants to take the time to learn more. In a sea of grids and san serif, Josie’s work is a breath of fresh air.</p><h1>3. Jason Mei</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*37m5pd32JArohCFG.jpg\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.jasonmei.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jason Mei’s Portfolio</a></p><p>Jason’s portfolio is clean, easy to navigate, and straightforward, but the little touches are what sets it apart from others.</p><p>The logo mark travels with you down the homepage, and instead of just hitting the bottom of the page, you get a short summary of his background, links to other relevant sites, and work history. The scrolling “Always a work in progress,” is also a nice way of acknowledging that design evolves, and so will your portfolio. If you click the message, it takes you to the Contact page with a brief manifesto of his design beliefs.</p><h1>4. Paula Wrzecionowska</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*bXkvXgO69oIjPdss.jpg\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.paulawrzecionowska.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Paula’s Portfolio</a></p><p>When recruiters or hiring managers are sifting through 50–100 UX portfolios for a single role, they may only look at one case study. Paula does a good job in her feature projects of summarizing the client/brand, task at hand, and work she did on the project in the rollover state.</p><p>By including that information, the viewer can choose what’s most relevant to them, instead of clicking on a random project that might not resonate.</p><h1>5. Gloria Ha</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*kjb20I56VHMasTqE.jpg\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.gloriaha.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gloria Ha Portfolio</a></p><p>This is another great portfolio website that adds unexpected touches and a bold personal brand into the viewing experience. Elements on the homepage animate if you stumble across them, but aren’t moving so quickly or intrusively as to detract from the work.</p><p>‘Gloria also has a good variety of work: a skincare e-commerce experience, a bank feature, and a travel booking redesign. Showing your versatility in this way can certainly help when looking for your first UX/UI design role.</p><h1>6. Aurora Shao</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*uEpngZ1HBACb6HdZ.jpeg\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.aurorashao.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Aurora Shao Portfolio</a></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*SG8TAeh0q7Oh41DL.jpeg\"></p><p>Aurora’s portfolio is clean, easy to navigate, and consistent, all while showcasing her illustrative skills. She does an excellent job of creating case studies that provide all of the relevant information in an engaging way. It’s tempting to have long blocks of writing due to the nature of your projects, but she’s broken things up into sections, added graphics and icons, and kept design at the forefront of each presentation.</p><h1>7. Jared Bartman</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*8LinUBlpy5yOQPJg.jpeg\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.jaredbartman.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jared Bartman Portfolio</a></p><p>So many portfolios are grid images on a white page, and while there’s nothing wrong with that approach, Jared’s portfolio stands out for its light grey background and use of color in general. One important feature is the “Back to Top” button on the right-hand side of the case study pages. Instead of having to scroll all the way back to the top of the page after you’re done, he’s made it much easier to navigate and keep going.</p><h1>8. Siriveena Nandam</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*y7AnRWHKApsZokgT.jpeg\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.sirirosa.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Siriveena Nandam Portfolio</a></p><p>Another great example of how a subtle color shift can make the design that much more compelling. Siriveena also has a nice variety of projects in her portfolio. It’s tempting to only pick what you find most interesting or exciting, but in the real world, you’d be much more likely to work on a very specific feature, or for an audience you have no expertise with. It’s nice to show that you’re interested and able to design for all, and it’s great to see Siriveena reflect that here.</p><h1>9. Katherine Chen</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*fIuUJzxhlsOtz2xo.png\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.chenkatherine.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Katherine Chen Portfolio</a></p><p>Katherine’s portfolio is clean, consistent, and easy to navigate, with section buttons on the left-hand side of the page for navigation on the case study pages.&nbsp;She also shows how to feature a confidential project, which will often happen as a designer.</p><p>The “Healthcare Staffing” case study shows you a bit of the branding, outlines the ask and deliverable, and when you click on it, brings you to a page where you can email her for access.</p><h1>10. Katie Lewis</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*Wdek-41LwDfXtrCb.jpeg\"></p><p><a href=\"https://katielizlewis.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Katie Lewis Portfolio</a></p><p>Katie’s portfolio is a great study in how to showcase past work and interests in a way that’s not distracting. She lets the viewer filter her work so you can quickly navigate from the homepage. We often emphasize the use of white space, but that doesn’t have to mean literal white. Katie uses a range of rich jewel tones in her grid that bring her projects to life and make her portfolio stand out from the crowd.</p><h1>What Makes a Good UX UI Design Portfolio?</h1><p>Each UX designer portfolio in this roundup is unique and stands out for a different reason. But it’s worth noting that each UI / UX portfolio site also embraces visual design and UX best practices to create a powerful, engaging experience for curious viewers and prospective employers alike.</p><p><br></p><p>As you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/avoid-an-identikit-ux-design-portfolio/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create your own portfolio</a>, remember that hiring managers aren’t looking at your UX case studies in a silo to see if they check all the right boxes. If the UX work displayed in the projects is stellar but your portfolio site as a whole contains bad UX, that can wave a red flag.</p><p><br></p>",

      "body": "<h1>20 Great Examples of How You Can Ruin User Experience</h1><p>So, let’s not keep you waiting: here they are — the most stupid mistakes in creating UX, which even experienced webmasters often make.</p><p><br></p><h2>#1 — Autoplay of audio/video</h2><p>Needless to say, one of the most annoying things that can overtake website users is the instantaneous audio playback when opening a web page. In short, instead of forcing your website visitors to turn down the volume in a hurry, just provide a default mute with an option to turn it off.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*2Y1hOCeGA4dxcfzIUWnrbg.jpeg\"></p><p>Make media content manageable.

Our furniture will fix that. Our sushi delivery will fix that. Our phones will fix it. Similar, perhaps less literal, phrases can be found on almost every website whose administrators decided to add a little relevance to its textual content. Please don’t do that. You shouldn’t drag any world problems to your business niche if it’s not connected with them.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ILBvd2b2wJGeMsCKnn2O2w.jpeg\"></p><p>A good example of using news content on a website. Designed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dribbble.com/earthr\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Earthr.</a></p><h2>#3 — Unstructured web forms</h2><p>The forms below are quite simple. They may not confuse anyone (although such cases also happen), but the “aftertaste” after visiting websites with such forms won’t be pleasant. Spend a few extra minutes to personalize your forms.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*DVzyF49aj3GPWe1GWbnx1A.jpeg\"></p><p>Personalization is key.

Believe us, this is not an easy task, especially for mobile users. Do not complicate their lives, this is not an easy thing, alas.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*jsCkf57syqpqjbKOnFxFCg.jpeg\"></p><p>Long dropdowns can be the shortest way to ruin UX</p><h2>#5 — Violation of the three-click rule</h2><p>Have you checked how many clicks a user needs to make on your website to complete the desired action? If for basic tasks this number exceeds three, something in your UX is definitely not right.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*lz9dXZDm9JFda8cz.jpeg\"></p><h2>#6 — Сhecklists with a large number of options</h2><p>Did you know that checklists were originally created so that the user could give a binary yes or no answer? This is not entirely true, there may be more options, but you definitely shouldn’t abuse them.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*mQKoFK7pE_SaShH4eY8C2g.jpeg\"></p><p>Don’t use too long checklists</p><h2>#7 — Plenty of tooltips</h2><p>Have you ever had tooltips clutter up important parts of the interface? We are sure that each of us has faced a similar situation.&nbsp;Indeed, if your interface requires such detailed explanations, perhaps it’s a bad interface and needs to be made more intuitive?</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*OB0P46-6LWDB8b-TsEXgQw.jpeg\"></p><h2>#8 — Low discoverability</h2><p>Are you sure that your users won’t have to look for a needle in a haystack? We are talking about features that should be visible to the naked eye. Decide on the priority functionality and only then complete the less important interface elements.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*pVF4tAzmG9xBYPo7.png\"></p><p>Analyze the user's needs.

In fact, people pay a lot of attention to color, and this rule applies to website color scheme as well. Therefore, instead of choosing something brighter, take an interest in what shades have the most beneficial effect on human perception.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*LjQbjYOnrp24gyRU.png\"></p><h2>#10 — Complex password requirements</h2><p>Do you share secret Pentagon data on your website? Or maybe post conspiracy theories? If this is not so, why allow only people with outstanding memory to access its resources?

This will quickly bother your visitors by having to constantly click ‘X’ to close the popup.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*071jy0dUVmuBEBITISRm6w.jpeg\"></p><p>Don’t force, just love</p><h2>#13 — Lack of intuitiveness</h2><p>Very often, the creative thinking of webmasters takes precedence over sanity. As a result, they create solutions, as in the example below. What to click, where to click?

Speak clearly.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*Fuy_Yr1CwEtvJ2-d.jpeg\"></p><h2>#15 — Empty space</h2><p>Too little content? Come on, if even when the Internet is turned off, Google finds something to captivate users with (we all played with pixel Tirex), you should also have enough imagination to fill in empty spaces on such a web page.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*-6NKwdAb8h3XmN0v.jpeg\"></p><p>A good example of how to use empty spaces</p><h2>#16 — Authorization issues</h2><p>Authorization on the website is a reason to increase conversion rates.

      "body": "<h1>What Is Information Architecture?</h1><p>Simply put, Information Architecture is the structure of all the information in your app or website. When we put care into the arrangement of information, we can make it easier to understand and navigate. It’s similar to how a writer starts with an outline before they write a story, or how an architect starts with a blueprint before they choose paint colors.</p><p>In essence, any digital product, website, or app is simply a collection of information. The practice of Information Architecture involves arranging this information in a way that is easy to understand, and can be scaled as the app or website grows (as you add features, for example).</p><p>An app or website that has good Information Architecture is&nbsp;structurally sound. It’s very much like a building. If we’re deliberate about what the important pillars are, and we start there, we have a solid foundation. When we have a solid foundation, we can continue to build without things getting too shaky.</p><h1>Example</h1><p>Let’s take Spotify as an example. We can deconstruct the UI to reveal the underlying Information Architecture.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*fsLfaYCEYFwZknUyOKWflA.png\"></p><h1>Why is Information Architecture Important?</h1><p><strong>If you want clean and focused design, you have to start with clean and focused Information Architecture.</strong>&nbsp;It forces us to do the thinking, so our users don’t have to.&nbsp;When we think about the Information Architecture of an app, we’re forced to view it — not as a collection of pages and pixels — but rather as a collection of abstract thoughts: nouns and verbs. Nothing more.</p><p>We quickly see that an app or website is just information. The way we piece that information together determines how well people will be able to navigate and consume it.</p><p>It’s just like constructing a thought, or sentence, or idea. The arrangement of the nouns and verbs in the sentence will determine how well the message is received.</p><p>An app is the same thing. An app is just a collection of nouns and verbs:&nbsp;“stuff”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“actions I can take on the stuff”. The nouns are the really important things. They make up the world of your app. The nouns in your app can be things like:</p><ul><li>Songs</li><li>Folders</li><li>Users</li><li>Photos</li><li>Restaurants</li><li>Money</li><li>Friends</li></ul><p>The verbs, on the other hand, are the&nbsp;actions&nbsp;the user can take on those nouns. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>Play&nbsp;a song</li><li>Create&nbsp;a folder</li><li>Create&nbsp;a user</li><li>Share&nbsp;a photo</li><li>Review&nbsp;a restaurant</li><li>Send&nbsp;money</li><li>Add&nbsp;friends</li></ul><p>So typically, in an app we can follow a certain pattern. A majority of the screen (roughly 80%) is devoted to displaying the “nouns”, and a smaller portion is devoted to displaying the “verbs” — the available actions that the user can take on those nouns.</p><h1>Good Information Architecture is Universal (And Timeless)</h1><p>Over time we see that good information architecture is universal. Certain principles and patterns seem to always prevail. Perhaps most obviously, the items in the top-most navigation of your app should be the most important things. For Spotify, those things are “Home”, “Browse”, “Search”, “Radio”, and “Your Library”. What are the most important things in your app? Try to limit it to 3–5 items.</p><p>Where things get interesting is when we realize that information wants to take on similar structures, regardless of the exact nature of the information. For example, a common pattern we see is that as we navigate deeper into the Information Architecture of an app, we tend to move from broad collections of items, toward specific items. This is often referred to as “drilling down”.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*iGead8SqzCfO1WDeUn3Iwg.png\"></p><p>While the UI has evolved, the underlying Information Architecture hasn’t changed much.</p><h1>Patterns Emerge</h1><p>Once we’ve designed enough apps, websites, and digital products — we start to realize that these structures of information are really all the same on some level. It’s just the names of the information that change. A good designer knows how to start with one of these tried and true structures. These structures, at their essence, are agnostic to the information they contain.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*x1lzOgff1VHYnjPEDlTW2A.png\"></p><p>Music…</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*nQHTmsN9ZyIYY3iLxnuXpw.png\"></p><p>…is the same as Photos</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*hTe-Ljz2873Mj9Qj_SW-HQ.png\"></p><p>…which are the same as “Things”</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*nNdx-JSh6oQvjGI6RkHmWw.png\"></p><p>…which are the same as — well, you get the point.</p><h1><strong>It’s All The Same Thing!</strong></h1><p>So we start with these agnostic structures. Then, as we start to “pour” information into these containers, we can start to customize the presentation to speak to the unique nature of the information contained within them. For example, information that is more visual, like Photos, will be presented differently than information that is more data-based, like Credit Card Transactions.</p><h1>Tips for Creating Good, Clean Information Architecture</h1><h2>1. Be very clear about what’s important (and what isn’t).</h2><p>Don’t be afraid to minimize the importance of some things, this is necessary to maximize the importance of others. Contrast is critical in providing clarity. Get rid of information where you can, and minimize it when you can’t.</p><h2>2. Think in terms of “buckets” of information</h2><p>Think about which things belong together. For example, a Profile section of your app is likely a good place to contain everything related to the user, rather than scattering them around the app.</p><h2>3. Don’t be afraid to revisit your Information Architecture</h2><p>Make sure to revisit your Information Architecture as your app or website evolves and grows. Teams often neglect to maintain their Information Architecture because they think it’s all-or-nothing: “we’d love to clean up our Information Architecture but we don’t have the resources to redesign the whole app.” Think in more incremental terms. There are probably a few things you could do easily to improve the structure of information in your product (and thereby improve the usability).</p><p><br></p>",

Systematic and iterative work methodology allows the team to deliver products that are of the highest quality, have business potential, and are tailored to the needs of potential users.&nbsp;<strong>Product design process</strong>&nbsp;is a useful tool for creating innovative and attractive business solutions, which helps to meet the growing expectations of customers and contributes to the success of enterprises.</p><p><strong>But what exactly is the process of creating a product from A to Z?</strong></p><h1>What is the Product Design Process?</h1><p>The&nbsp;<strong>product design process&nbsp;</strong>is based on the popular&nbsp;<strong>Design Thinking</strong>&nbsp;methodology. According to its creator, Tim Brown, it is a&nbsp;<strong>human-centred approach&nbsp;</strong>to innovation that integrates the needs of people, the capabilities of technology, and the business requirements needed to achieve success. Interestingly, this methodology is used not only when designing and creating digital products, but also in various physical services and products. One effective tool that allows users to describe Design Thinking as alternating cycles of divergent (expanding, exploratory) and convergent (narrowing, analytical) thinking is&nbsp;<strong>Double Diamond.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*85M5CxfQw6gaUKC6TuORhA.png\"></p><p><strong>Double Diamond</strong>&nbsp;is a great tool that illustrates the design process, but you may feel that some steps are missing from it. Depending on how the individual sections of a Double Diamond are interpreted, the end result can be either a prototype or a ready-to-market product — two completely different things. For this reason, at Miquido we use the&nbsp;<strong>Triple Diamond scheme</strong>, which additionally includes the aspect of cooperation with development teams, without which it is difficult to imagine a product design process. It consists of several phases that structure the work on the project.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*-OVgtE2hMUNTKzxd_xMfpw.png\"></p><p><strong>Triple Diamond</strong>&nbsp;is a flexible method, which means that it is tough to clearly define the exact framework of action based on this concept. The scope of work performed during the process depends on two major factors: the complexity of the identified problem and the work already done on the client’s side. But what does this really mean?</p><p>Imagine two different scenarios. The first, when the client has nothing but a general idea, and the second, when the client wants to plan new features or conduct the next development phase. This&nbsp;<strong>flexibility&nbsp;</strong>is an inherent part of the&nbsp;<strong>Triple Diamond&nbsp;</strong>method! In addition,&nbsp;<strong>Design Thinking</strong>&nbsp;is characterised by an&nbsp;<strong>interactive approach</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>non-linearity</strong>. Instead of going through each stage of the process, some of the phases may be repeated many times until satisfactory results are obtaine</p><h1>Discovery</h1><p>If you don’t have a clearly defined goal or problem to solve, you can expect two things — wasted time and inefficiency. The result of your design process may be solutions that do not match user needs. They can also lead to an&nbsp;<strong>incorrectly defined project scope</strong>&nbsp;or other unforeseen problems. Although the client or team may feel that they know the answers to all questions and want to go straight to the implementation, it is important first to adjust and verify the assumptions we set for ourselves. That is why it is necessary to get into the customer’s shoes to understand their needs deeply and to recognise the hidden factors that affect human choices and behaviour. Therefore, well-conducted<strong>&nbsp;user research</strong>&nbsp;should be the foundation of the&nbsp;<strong>product design process</strong>.</p><p><br></p><h2>Problem Discovery</h2><p>In the product design process,&nbsp;<strong>the discovery phase</strong>&nbsp;allows us to verify our assumptions, collect and analyse data, which helps us determine the purpose, potential and threats of a given project. Thanks to problem discovery, we can, among other things, determine and systematise customer requirements, analyse the needs of the target group or assess the market potential of the designed product.</p><p><br></p><p>The tools that are often used at this stage (depending on the type of project) are:</p><ul><li><strong>UX audit:</strong>&nbsp;to review an existing digital product to ensure it meets business, UX, and accessibility requirements.</li><li><strong>Individual in-depth interview:</strong>&nbsp;to deeply understand the users and reach their needs, motivations and problems.</li><li><strong>Market research:&nbsp;</strong>to reveal the target group and trends for a product or service.</li><li><strong>Protopersonas:</strong>&nbsp;to give an organisation a starting point to evaluate the product and create some early design hypotheses.</li><li><strong>Data analysis:</strong>&nbsp;to answer all the “how many” and “how often” questions.</li><li><strong>Service blueprint:&nbsp;</strong>to see the service delivery process from the customer’s perspective, and break down a project into manageable chunks and milestones.</li><li><strong>Survey:</strong>&nbsp;to collect customer feedback and help you make sense of user behaviour.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*BK_lu8n6rVXtBZoxPqxMMw.png\"></p><h2>Problem definition</h2><p>In the&nbsp;<strong>problem definition phase</strong>, it is essential to analyse all the collected data and extract the most important information. The second product design process stage is the time to define the major needs and problems of users that your product will solve. Defining it is a crucial step, directly affecting the direction in which the team is going when designing the solution.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the most important tools used during the problem definition phase are:</p><ul><li><strong>Product vision:&nbsp;</strong>to describe the overarching long-term mission of the product.</li><li><strong>Value proposition:</strong>&nbsp;to focus the team’s attention on the development goal throughout the process (as a kind of visual aid).</li><li><strong>Problem statement:</strong>&nbsp;to accurately define a problem.</li><li><strong>Strategic research:&nbsp;</strong>to answer future-facing questions about users that help inform the long-term product direction and roadmap.</li></ul><h2>Problem Validation</h2><p>Once the problem is defined, it is important to validate it. We must verify if the idea needs to be modified and whether it fits the market. Choosing the wrong design challenge can lead to creating a product that does not suit user needs properly. For this purpose, conducting further studies may be useful, including&nbsp;<strong>focus groups, user interviews, surveys and observations.</strong></p><p><br></p><blockquote><em>If you need help with a UX Research Plan or persuading your client to do some research, check out&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/1113390322615257554\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>our template in Figjam</em></a><em>. It will let you plan and organise the research phase step by step!</em></blockquote><p><br></p><h1>Pre-production</h1><p>The next step is the&nbsp;<strong>pre-production phase</strong>. During this product design process step, the team generates ideas for solving a predefined problem and creates the foundations for designing the UI of the application.<strong>&nbsp;Brainstorming</strong>&nbsp;is a good idea to unleash your imagination and generate as many ideas as possible without focusing on limitations. Despite its spontaneous character, brainstorming is an important step that allows us to work with stakeholders to develop an idea for a solution.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from brainstorming, several different tools are equally and extremely useful during the pre-production phase:</p><ul><li><strong>Customer journey map:</strong>&nbsp;to visualise all user interactions with our product and recreate the process he is experiencing.</li><li><strong>Personas:</strong>&nbsp;to understand who the user is, what motivations are behind his decisions and what kind of communication he expects. It allows the designer to focus on what is important from the users’ point of view.</li><li><strong>User scenarios:</strong>&nbsp;to define in what situations and for what purposes the users intend to use the product.</li><li><strong>Mind map:&nbsp;</strong>to help generate new ideas and identify relationships among different data and information.</li></ul><p>Then, the design team creates a user flow, sketches a potential solution and builds a prototype based on the selected idea. It does not have to be exact. Most importantly, the prototype should allow testing of the concept with potential users and let them interact with the product. Prototypes enable us to test our idea’s validity and eliminate errors at an early stage of work. The results of such tests can help the team and stakeholders decide whether they want to continue the project.</p><h1>Design &amp; Development</h1><p>Based on the previous steps and the so-called&nbsp;<strong>“proof of concept”</strong>, we can continue working on the physical representation of our solution: flows, screens, and UI. At the same time, we should remember that both users and stakeholders have verified our ideas. Therefore, we should correct the errors we caught while&nbsp;<strong>testing the prototype</strong>&nbsp;and learn from them.</p><p><br></p><p>The result of the design team’s work is the implementation of the solution and its introduction to the market by development teams. It involves a lot of collaboration between designers, the client, engineers and other implementation team members. At Miquido, we often use a helpful method called&nbsp;<strong>User Story Mapping</strong>&nbsp;to build a product backlog. At this stage, we can also think about&nbsp;<strong>designing tests</strong>, like A/B tests, which will allow us to check the functioning of certain aspects of the product on the real market. We should constantly monitor metrics, compare them with previously established KPIs and, depending on the results, plan to redesign the product in such a way as to best suit the needs of users and meet business goals.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Let me summarise things briefly. Firstly, the product design process is not as complicated as it may seem. Going through each of the stages from the&nbsp;<strong>Design Thinking methodology</strong>&nbsp;allows us to:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>understand user desires</li><li>address user needs</li><li>generate new ideas</li><li>design a useful (and profitable!) solution — ready for further tests or market implementation.</li></ul><p>Secondly, it is always worth&nbsp;<strong>exploring various tools&nbsp;</strong>and checking what we feel best at and what is the easiest and most effective way to work for our team. No one ready solution works for all, and every company and designer has their favourite approaches and ways of working.</p><p>Last but not least, there is no doubt that the&nbsp;<strong>product design process</strong>&nbsp;framework facilitates both designer and client work. Whether creating a brand new product or developing additional functionalities, the product design process saves designers a lot of time and guarantees better product results.</p>",

      "description": "Working as a product designer in a software house is associated with many different challenges. The first one is to be versatile — after all, a product designer is not only the user’s advocate (just like UX designer), but also helps to achieve the client’s goals. Creativity and analytical thinking are needed, as well as the ability to cooperate with many stakeholders at once — clients, project managers, analysts, testers and developers. Their work not only leads to the creation of an interface that pleases the eye but, above all, to the success of the entire product. This includes conceptual work, strategy and implementation, which is focused on delivering real business value, not just positive UX.",

This way, when designers swap out one status color for another, they are guaranteed by the design system that the color contrast ratio still passes the accessibility requirement.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*GEz1v3sVo_FrR1cIBZDmaw.png\"></p><p>In this design, we don’t want the “in progress” tag to be any more prominent than the “finished” tag”. Using the relative luminance as a guide would help the colors to carry a similar emphasis.</p><h1>Problem</h1><p>Yet trouble occurs when I try setting the yellow color to carry the same relative luminance of around 0.15 as all the other main status colors in the color palette. I just cannot make it happen.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*GFsiXnfxGG-yUeR6_tdKIw.png\"></p><p>Colors and their relative luminance</p><p>I can simply darken the yellow, but this will make it brown. For users who are acquainted with the “traffic light” coloring scheme (red means bad, yellow means warning, green means good), this will create a lot of confusion.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*RZXOLvjeeqzpex5f60ZgZw.png\"></p><p>Darkening the yellow will make it brown, breaking people’s perception of a traffic light system.</p><p>Modifying the color hue by making the yellow a little more green or red does not fully address the problem either. Moreover, now the yellow color is too close to red or green, causing even more confusion.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/686/1*nVeS_gRftQzqKLBTyJouYQ.png\"></p><p>This is what I call&nbsp;<strong>the dark yellow problem:</strong>&nbsp;trying to come up with a shade of yellow to make it accessible and align with other colors in the palette. But&nbsp;<em>there’s just no such a thing as a “dark yellow”</em>. Yellow, by definition, needs to stay light.</p><h1>Solution</h1><p>Since there’s no way to change yellow itself, I decided to focus on&nbsp;<strong>regulating how yellows can be used</strong>. UI governance is a critical aspect of a functional design system, and that includes the use of colors.</p><p><br></p><p>In short, while other colors may enjoy a wide range of varieties in how they can be used to stylize a component, yellow (and by extension, orange) should never be used as a foreground color, and should never be used alone without a dark UI element near it to explain its meaning.</p><h2>No Foreground Yellow</h2><p>Yellow color must never be used against a white / light background. I still encourage people to use a dark yellow shade (a.k.a. brown) as text.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/574/1*cM2Pp3_6ku6uwYIGA6PHIQ.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/574/1*B454lyIl2Cb_MxuRqK0KzA.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/574/1*-Vuph_S7QYfyyAOOgTJDJw.png\"></p><p>If you don’t call these out, you won’t believe that unsophisticated people can blindly follow a pattern…</p><h2>Accompanied Dark Element</h2><p>Building on the previous rule, a yellow UI element must always be accompanied by some darker-shaded UI elements such as text and icons to articulate its meaning.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Rxs-Upe5m8IrDDXwTznlXw.png\"></p><p>The first two color schemes use only a yellow color to convey the “caution” status; it violates the “yellow + dark” rule.</p><p>In places like dashboards where the real estate is rather limited, consider using multi-colored icons, or even outline your icons.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*_1xgj70F48SE24h5oM8EEA.png\"></p><p>Tweak your yellow icons to ensure the color contrast against a white background is above 3:1, the color contrast threshold for non-text elements like icons.</p><p>On desktops, it might also be interesting to do this, where the yellow-ness is not as prominent, but the user gets sufficiently warned before committing to the action:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/515/1*8aOqGWQwJ8oKc9q-cEiSxQ.gif\"></p><p>On the desktop, designers can implement a hover state. In the default state, the text has sufficient contrast; when the mouse cursor is hovering over the button, it turns yellow to deliver the impact of a warning.</p><h1>Three Shades of Yellow</h1><p>When defining my main palette, I specified three shades for each color: light, main and dark, an idea borrowed from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/palette/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MUI’s theme structure</a>. I picked my yellow shades in a way that can suit all the needs listed above.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/366/1*Z3-7A-fzDVuqEt-tF8fFIQ.png\"></p><p>The gap between “main” and “dark” in the yellow shades is more significant compared to other colors because the yellow color is used differently.</p><p>A tokenized approach, as opposed to a meaningless color palette where colors range from 50 to 900, allows me to easily summarize how to use these yellow shades with other UI colors:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*78Xs1ADrhdHfuLQmG9yU4Q.png\"></p><h1>Related Works</h1><ul><li><a href=\"https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/tips-create-accessible-color-palette/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tips to Create an Accessible and Contrasted Color Palette</em></a>&nbsp;by Stéphanie Walter, also features specific text treatment on their yellow palette</li><li><a href=\"https://stripe.com/blog/accessible-color-systems\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Designing accessible color systems</em></a>&nbsp;by designers from Stripe, who developed a tool to determine their colors in the arguably better LAB color space</li></ul><p><br></p>",

I left my graphic designer job in March, and entered the maze of the coding world. Five months later, I finally got a job as a front-end developer at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tenten.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tenten.co</a>.</p><p>Having been a full-time front-end developer for six months, I’d like to share my story of why and how I pivoted my life path. This is for those who might be as helpless but ambitious as I am.</p><p>To be clear, this post is not written from the perspective of a seasoned developer or designer who’s able to illustrate a clear road map to follow. Neither is it a crash course for learning front-end development. There are lots of great tutorials on this topic, and I will list some later in the article.</p><p>Remember, the perfect (universal) path for all individuals does not exist.</p><h1>My Background</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*c0Fyn78L-3mAwOI7Y0I5-Q.png\"></p><p>My&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.behance.net/vinceshaodesign\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Behance</a>&nbsp;page</p><p>I was a 24 year old graphic designer with no experience related to coding at all. In my school days, my exam scores of math, physics, chemistry and science were horribly low. These subjects scared me with dull and complex formulas, numbers, and errors. Things that interested me back then were always the beauty created by paint, music, or words. Naturally, I chose English as my major, and got fascinated by literature, culture, photography and design in college.</p><p>How I learned how to design in college by myself and finally became a graphic designer after graduation is story for another day. The point is, throughout my entire life until last year, I’d dreamed of being a writer, photographer, film critic, singer and designer, but I never thought of being a developer under any circumstances.</p><h1>Why I Wanted to Code</h1><p>For me, graphic design serves the purpose of solving a problem with attractive visual forms supported by invisible systems or structures.</p><p><br></p><p>As the world is facing so many critical issues, I believe that problem-solving design thinking can and should help deal with some of these issues. Of course I was only trying to layout something beautiful the first time I opened Photoshop. Yet, the more I learned about design, the more I craved to engage in critical issues with graphic design.</p><p>But, after many endeavors to achieve my ambition, I was deeply disappointed at the impact that graphic design could make in Taiwan (or maybe the whole world?).</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Design &amp; Thinking&nbsp;Official Trailer by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.murismedia.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Muris Media</a>. The documentary tells the power of design thinking.</p><p>There’s no doubt that I’m still aware of the power and importance of great design. But most of the time, designers are only allowed to deal with the “client’s problem,” instead of tackling “real problems client have.” Designers spend most of the time guessing their client’s wishes with no profound data and analysis, but only intuition, experience, or common sense.</p><p>I got tired of this game two years into my graphic design career.</p><p>That’s when I decided to take a serious look at the always trending front-end development topic on Medium.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://designintechreport.wordpress.com/2017/03/12/design-in-tech-report-2017-video/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Design in Tech Report</a>&nbsp;in 2017 by John Maeda. This report taught me the potential impact a computational designer could make could be way more than a classic one.</p><p>I found that being a developer with design skills allowed you to have way more control and authority over each case and client. Besides, working on web development or applications allows you to efficiently propagate information.</p><p>I left my graphic design job at the end of February. With no elaborate plan and limited saving in the bank, I started my journey of transforming into a front-end developer.</p><h1>What to Do</h1><p>Taking the first step is always hard. But if you recognize what the reason propelling you is, things get simpler. For example, if your purpose of becoming a developer is getting paid better ASAP, then you should learn the hot stuff in the market.</p><p><br></p><p>In my case, because I realized that my current goal was to earn the power to combine design with development skills, I focused on showcasing both abilities.</p><p>So, I set a goal, and made a list of required tasks with my shallow understanding of front-end development:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*ehSmyC2xi9z8bG9otjGrWA.jpeg\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*CCaJtFsUPWsVG-8EFCzYnw.jpeg\"></p><p>List of skills I wanted to learn and the rough plan I sketched on paper</p><h2>1. Goal</h2><p>Get a front-end developer job</p><p><br></p><h2>2. How to achieve the goal</h2><p>Build my portfolio site for showcasing my ability</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Tasks to do</h2><ul><li>Learn HTML, CSS, jQuery/JavaScript</li><li>Design portfolio site</li><li>Portfolio works preparation</li></ul><p>I assigned only these tasks for myself at first. But as I read more articles, tutorials, or job requirements, I put these skills on the list along the way:</p><ul><li>Sass</li><li>Gulp</li><li>CS50</li><li>Basic Unix</li><li>Basic Wordpress</li><li>Jekyll</li><li>Basic AWS knowledge</li><li>Basic networking knowledge</li></ul><p><em>Note: To be sure, the exploding information on web bombed me with more things to learn. In the five months, I had once put Node.js, React.js, PHP and more on the list. The tasks above were the ones that I actually completed in the end.</em></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*N6Tzds89N7vBldKTOK1klQ.png\"></p><p>My Toggl report from March to July in 2017</p><p>To follow the plan, I set a 48hr/week working goal for myself. It meant I had to work eight hours a day with only one day off in a week.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://toggl.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Toggl</strong></a>&nbsp;helped me keep track of my performance.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Km80CyFd9l3msXRoce6lxQ.png\"></p><p>Asana for schedule</p><p>Also, I took a&nbsp;<em>long-term goal -&gt; monthly goal -&gt; weekly agenda -&gt; daily agenda</em>&nbsp;method to make my learning schedule, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://asana.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Asana</strong></a>&nbsp;was my best assistant on managing these tasks.</p><h1>Where to Learn</h1><p>I tried to learn from many platforms, tutorials, or articles along the way. Here’s the list of the resources and my thoughts to each of them:</p><p><br></p><h2>Learning Platforms</h2><p>Back then, I hated the tutorials that showed me lines of codes I didn’t have any idea what to do with. Some assumed that I knew every bit of it, or they told me to ignore it for now. Please, I genuinely didn’t understand even a line of the code on the screen, because I was a&nbsp;<strong>TOTAL BEGINNER</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Those kinds of lectures pained me, and made me looked down on myself. Generally, there’s no perfect platform to learn everything. I tried to be as flexible as I could, jumping between each of them.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://codecademy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Codecademy</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>—<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Lots of people recommended it, but I was pretty frustrated by its tutorials back then. I always stuck in practice without any clues.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.codeschool.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Code<strong>&nbsp;</strong>School</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>—<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I spent lots of time here, because the teachers explain the whys clearly.

Treehouse has done a great job on marketing, which works (at least for me as a lost beginner back then). It covers so many topics, some of which were really useful for me. For example, it’s hard to find a decent tutorial of Wordpress for front-end developer students out there, but Treehouse has one.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">freeCodeCamp</a>&nbsp;— Huge love for freeCodeCamp! This community has a clear path for beginners to follow, and it knows when to take the training wheels away from student. I was once anxious about what to do next after learning basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but freeCodeCamp put small projects on the right spots in the learning track. The community also shares great posts on Medium and by emails. Highly recommended!</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*mH1IP2Gb515C9bm93KxbPg.png\"></p><p>My bookmarks of learning platforms in Safari</p><h2>Youtube Channel</h2><p>This is the best place to learn for free or for fun.

I had also completed almost 80% of my portfolio site. At the same time, my remaining savings were only enough for me to live on for another couple of months.</p><p><br></p><p>It was time to look for a new job.</p><p>Unfortunately, I had barely any choices at all. Not many companies wanted a man with no relative development experience/background, and even fewer appreciated the value of my graphic design abilities. It was also sad to have fewer than five job opportunities that were possibly a fit for me. On the bright side, the situation forced me to focus on these precious chances.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*8EqiNBNjzQClrMkpgrVBog.png\"></p><p>🔥<a href=\"http://tenten.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tenten.co</a>&nbsp;🔥</p><p>I had been watching the design agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tenten.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tenten</a>&nbsp;for at least three years. It is the one and only agency that’s able to harness design, digital development, and innovation at the same time in Taiwan. I’ve had them on my “please hire me” list for a long time, and I believed Tenten was the only company here that would be sold on my multi-disciplinary skills as well.</p><p>In the last two months of my journey, I learned as much as I could about Tenten’s junior front-end developer position. Meanwhile, I completed my personal site. When the time was ripe, I applied for the position. As backup plans, I sent my resume and portfolio to other five companies as well. And I waited.</p><p>And finally…</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*U8Voa7O-f6xcDS6ZDZyE-Q.jpeg\"></p><h1><strong>In Retrospect</strong></h1><p>Looking back, I still wouldn’t say that transforming myself from a designer to a developer was easy, but it wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be, either. The hardest part of the process was never understanding or writing the code, but having the powerful motivation that drives you forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Congratulations if you’ve found this motivation. If you haven’t, give it more try before you quit. If you never try, you’ll never know.</p><p>The most important lesson I learned along the way was to start doing something ASAP. I know it’s terrifying to take the first step of actually building something, but it’s the only way to truly learn something. Remember, you have nothing to lose anyway.</p><p>The days and hardships after formally becoming a developer are another story.</p><p>I’m so glad to have been a front-end developer at Tenten for 6 months now. The journey of learning never ends!</p>",

People got used to seeing content and functionality of the digital products as many of them are now: structured and easy to use. However, it doesn’t occur unintentionally. Designers and developers take a responsibility of constructing content and navigation system in the appropriate way for users perception. The science that assists experts in the content structuring is called information architecture. Today’s article is devoted to the essence of information architecture and presents the basic points every designer should know.</p><h1>What’s information architecture?</h1><p>Information architecture (IA) is a science of organizing and structuring content of the websites, web and mobile applications, and social media software. An American architect and graphic designer, Richard Saul Wurman, is considered to be a founder of the IA field. Today, there are many specialists working on IA development who have established the Information Architecture Institute. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.iainstitute.org/what-is-ia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IAI experts</a>, information architecture is the practice of deciding how to arrange the parts of something to be understandable.</p><p>Information architecture aims at organizing content so that users would easily adjust to the functionality of the product and could find everything they need without big effort. The content structure depends on various factors. First of all, IA experts consider the specifics of the target audience needs because IA puts user satisfaction as a priority. Also, the structure depends on the type of the product and the offers companies have. For example, if we compare a retail website and a blog, we’ll see two absolutely different structures both efficient for accomplishing certain objectives. Information architecture has become the fundamental study in many spheres including design and software development.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*zsitinTuq77ceCIz.jpg\"></p><h1>The role of information architecture in design</h1><p>Nowadays, when the user-centered approach in design is a top trend, many designers learn the principles of information architecture science which they believe is a foundation of efficient design. IA forms a skeleton of any design project. Visual elements, functionality, interaction, and navigation are built according to the information architecture principles. The thing is that even compelling content elements and powerful UI design can fail without appropriate IA. Unorganized content makes navigation difficult and inexplicit, so the users can easily get lost and feel annoyed. If the users face first bad interaction, they may not give the second chance to your product.</p><p>Many companies don’t see the importance of information architecture because they think it’s impractical. It’s hard to argue that IA takes some time to create it and requires specific skills to do it efficiently. However, powerful IA is a guarantee of the high-quality product since it reduces the possibility of the usability and navigation problems. This way, well-thought information architecture can save both time and money of the company which otherwise they would have spent on fixing and improvement.</p><h1>IA and UX design</h1><p>After reading everything written above, many people may have the question: “Isn’t IA the same as UX design?”. Technically, these terms relate to each other but they are far not the same.&nbsp;IA is a blueprint of the design structure which can be generated into wireframes and sitemaps of the project. UX designers use them as the basic materials so that they could plan navigation system.</p><p>UX design means much more than content structuring. In the first place, UX designers aim at making pleasant interaction model, so that users feel comfortable using the product. They encompass various aspects influencing users’ behavior and actions such as emotion and psychology when the IA experts stay focused on the user’s goals.</p><p>Let’s get this straight: good information architecture is a foundation of efficient user experience, so the IA skill is essential for the designers. Effective IA makes the product easy to use but only united with design thinking the product has the powerful user experience.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*N9a-1bMiqrGw_K_W.jpg\"></p><h1>IA system components</h1><p>If you want to build strong information architecture for the product, you need to understand what it consists of. Pioneers of the IA field, Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville in their book “Information Architecture for the World Wide Web” have distinguished four main components: organization systems, labeling systems, navigation systems and searching systems.</p><h1>Organization systems</h1><p>These are the groups or the categories in which the information is divided. Such system helps users to predict where they can find certain information easily. There are three main organizational structures: Hierarchical, Sequential, and Matrix.</p><p><strong>Hierarchical.</strong>&nbsp;In one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tubikstudio.com/tips-on-applying-copy-content-in-user-interfaces/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">previous articles</a>, we’ve mentioned a well-known technique of content organization which is called visual hierarchy. It is initially based on Gestalt psychological theory and its main goal is to present content on the carrier, be it a book page or poster, web page or mobile screen, in such a way that users can understand the level of importance for each element. It activates the ability of the brain to distinguish objects on the basis of their physical differences, such as size, color, contrast, alignment etc.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*Kp7POZ-2mkTKZkIM.png\"></p><p><a href=\"http://tubikstudio.com/case-study-big-city-guide-landing-page-design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Big City Guide</strong></a></p><p><strong>Sequential.</strong>&nbsp;This structure creates some kind of a path for the users. They go step-by-step through content to accomplish the task they needed. This type is often used for the retail websites or apps, where people have to go from one task to another to make the purchase.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*f_zmzagzA5XuzBqT.gif\"></p><p><a href=\"http://tubikstudio.com/case-study-vinnys-bakery-ui-design-for-e-commerce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Vinny’s Bakery Website</strong></a></p><p><strong>Matrix.</strong>&nbsp;This type is a bit more complicated for the users since they choose the way of navigation on their own. Users are given choices of content organization. For example, they can navigate through content which is ordered according to date, or some may prefer navigation along the topic.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*6B4CKx-4XXvrRQal.png\"></p><p><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/2834048-Moneywise-App\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MoneyWise App</strong></a></p><p>In addition, content can be grouped according to the organization schemes. They are meant to categorize content the product. Here are some of the popular schemes:</p><p><strong>Alphabetical schemes.</strong>&nbsp;Content is organized in alphabetical order. Also, they can serve as a navigation tool for the users.</p><p><strong>Chronological schemes.</strong>&nbsp;This type organizes content by date.</p><p><strong>Topic schemes.</strong>&nbsp;Content is organized according to the specific subject.</p><p><strong>Audience schemes.</strong>&nbsp;The type of content organization for separate groups of users.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*ZR08hq0GgxvxiR_S.png\"></p><p><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/2778634-Book-Swap-App\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Book Swap App</strong></a></p><h1>Labeling systems</h1><p>This system involves the ways of data representation. Design of the product requires simplicity, so a great amount of information can confuse users. That’s why designers create the labels which represent loads of data in few words. For example, when the designers give contact information of the company on the website, it usually includes the phone number, email, and social media contacts. However, designers can’t present all of this information on one page. The button “Contact” in the header of the page is a label that triggers the associations in the users’ heads without placing the whole data on the page. So, the labeling system aims at uniting the data effectively.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*7GKTuJWWa58v4NNQ.gif\"></p><p><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/2795275-Gym-Landing-Page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gym Landing Page</strong></a></p><h1>Navigation systems</h1><p>In one of our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tubikstudio.com/uiux-design-glossary-navigation-elements/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UX Glossary</a>&nbsp;articles, we’ve defined navigation as the set of actions and techniques guiding users throughout the app or website, enabling them to fulfill their goals and successfully interact with the product. The navigation system, in terms of IA, involves the ways how users move through content. It’s a complex system which employs many techniques and approaches, the reason why it’s wrong to describe it in a short paragraph. So, we’ll go back to the topic a bit later on our new blog’s article.</p><h1>Searching systems</h1><p>This system is used in information architecture to help users search for the data within the digital product like a website or an app. The searching system is effective only for the products with loads of information when the users risk getting lost there. In this case, the designers should consider a search engine, filters, and many other tools helping users find content and plan how the data will look after the search.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*z8zX2H3h7ypXat4m.jpg\"></p><p>To sum up, we can claim that information architecture is a core part of the powerful user experience design. Efficient IA helps users quickly and easily navigate through content and find everything they need without striking a blow. That’s why designers are recommended to learn the basics of the IA science.</p><p>The topic of information architecture is wide and there are more interesting and useful aspects. Our next article on this theme will be devoted to the various techniques and methodologies which designers employ to create efficient IA.

      "body": "<p>Similar to building architects using a blueprint to construct every part of a house, from physical structures to more complex inner workings like electrical and plumbing, information architecture describes the hierarchy, navigation, features, and interactions of a website or application. And just as blueprints are the most valuable document for an architect to use in the construction of a building, information architecture can be the most powerful tool in a designer’s arsenal.</p><p>However, developing one isn’t as simple as putting a list of features together and mapping out how they work — let’s investigate the process.</p><h1>What Is Information Architecture, and Why Is It Important?</h1><p>Information architecture (IA) is,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2010/02/Information_Architecture_Tutorial_-_Lesson_1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">like a blueprint</a>, a visual representation of the product’s infrastructure, features, and hierarchy. The level of detail is up to the designer, so IA may also include navigation, application functions and behaviors, content, and flows. There is no set limit to the size or shape of IA; nevertheless, it should encompass the generalized structure of the product so anyone (theoretically) should be able to read it and understand how the product works.</p><p>We’ll use the blueprint reference often because the purpose of both documents is nearly identical. Just like a blueprint, IA provides designers (as well as product development and engineering teams) a bird’s-eye view of the entire product.&nbsp;Having a single document that delivers a simple and understandable representation of how the application or website works is vital for developing new features, updating existing ones, and for seeing what is possible considering the existing product.</p><p>With IA available, it becomes significantly easier to make key decisions for new features and implementations, to understand timelines for product changes, and to follow user behavior through multiple processes.</p><p><strong>Let’s dive into a basic video to see how an IA is built.</strong></p><h1>How to Design Information Architecture</h1><p>As part of the UX process, IA design follows very similar patterns to flowcharting: Add shapes and connect them with lines in an organized fashion to a single document. The challenge when building IA is in understanding&nbsp;how&nbsp;your app or website actually works from the user’s perspective, and how to organize that information into a readable, legible format.</p><p>There are two major requirements for actually constructing IA: organizing it through a visual hierarchy (that is, a hierarchy of features, functions, and behavior) and creating a legend for displaying different types of features, interactions, and flows. With a standard flowchart, the shapes follow specific requirements (rectangles are processes, diamonds are decision points, etc.); however, following that nomenclature isn’t a requirement.</p><p>In other words, the most important factors in building your IA are where individual components of the architecture are placed (hierarchically), and how they’re labeled and displayed.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*lEZix02xG_svbtR1.gif\"></p><p>Information architecture by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dribbble.com/shots/3317909-Industrial-Analytics-Product-Information-Architecture\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Yegor Mytrofanov</a></p><h1>Understanding and Showing Visual Hierarchy</h1><p>The most challenging aspect of creating a new information architecture is almost always in constructing it hierarchically. It’s a common misconception that IA must be built “from the top down.” That’s almost always more difficult to do unless it’s an existing product, such as in the video above.</p><p>When building IA from scratch, unless your website or application is following a standard format, drawing out anything after the top level is very difficult. It’s like asking a mechanic to build a car from the top down instead of in parts. Each piece has to be constructed in advance with its own research, time for design, and development. The same is true with IA.</p><p>Displaying visual hierarchy is a valuable asset to IA, not only because it provides better context for the reader, but also generalizes key regions of the product. If your app’s most significant feature is ordering a ride (a la Uber or Lyft) which can be done from the homepage, then that page will have the most touchpoints and the most value to the product. The same will be true for the visual hierarchy.</p><p>Sitemaps come in handy for understanding hierarchy since they organize pages numerically (such as 1.0 Home, 2.0 Payment, 2.1 Add Pay Method, etc.). Or consider the example in the image below for Duke University’s library website, where the top navigation isn’t only at the top but also highlighted to be visible across the entire application.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*shO1vQneXNdE2f7r.png\"></p><p>The structure of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.library.duke.edu/blog/2013/03/20/information-architecture-plans-for-the-library-website/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Duke’s site</a>&nbsp;is straightforward: The homepage displays global navigation links plus content, and each global link leads to a variety of pages of relative stature.</p><h1>Hierarchy of Shapes, Colors, and Other Visual Elements</h1><p>Aside from hierarchy, the architecture above does another thing well: It displays every engagement point uniquely as needed through a simple legend and a few key phrases. The legend denotes page and content type, and it signifies variations between colors of shapes. This is important because, though Duke’s site appears fairly simple, the IA only goes three levels deep. Each yellow rectangle denotes an application, so the processes within each of those boxes aren’t included in this document!</p><p>Even without those parts available, the structure is such that we can understand how to navigate the website through the IA alone. That stops when we reach an application within the website — it doesn’t have to.</p><p>The IA below is for a game. Using four shapes, no color, and smartly-placed text snippets, every major interaction is understandable without prototypes, and more importantly, it can be understood by anyone working on it.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*LUFUFd0LE6LO1RSW.png\"></p><p>A student IA —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.behance.net/queendychan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Queendy Chan</a></p><p>This model isn’t perfect, but it organizes app hierarchy clearly and delineates what the user either sees or does at any given point.</p><h1>The Best Information Architecture Tools</h1><p>There are plenty of software applications that allow for building an IA, but few are simple and quick enough to make the experience enjoyable. Or at the very least, easy to manage.</p><p>Draw.io, used in the video above, is completely free for personal and professional use and automatically plugs into Google Drive. It also has integrations with Confluence and JIRA, which are paid.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.draw.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Draw.io</a>&nbsp;is excellent for flowcharting, creating user flows and information architecture, and with Drive functionality, multiple people can work on the same document and see changes live. There’s also a free offline version.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lucidchart.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lucidchart</a>&nbsp;is another great tool that provides a slightly better experience than Draw.io and has additional benefits like pre-built templates, many more integrations, a mobile app (rated at 2.5 stars on the App Store), and support for the enterprise.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*YGp5oGPqYlb43yLX.png\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.toptal.com/designers/ia/www.draw.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Draw.io</a>&nbsp;is a free online tool for creating flowcharts, diagrams, information architecture, and more.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Omnigraffle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-us/visio/flowchart-software?tab=tabs-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visio</a>&nbsp;are long-time industry mainstays and work excellently for building and maintaining an IA design, though Visio is online only (the older offline version is Windows-only) whereas Omnigraffle is Mac-only and requires separate purchases for the macOS and iOS versions. OmniGraffle has one benefit over the major competitors in that it provides JavaScript and AppleScript automation, which for most designers may be unnecessary, but typically, full-time information architects appreciate it.</p><p>All of the tools listed above are made for speed and ease of use, specifically around flowcharting, which follows nearly identical principles to information architecture. Other applications like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.balsamiq.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Balsamiq</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindmeister.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MindMeister</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindjet.com/mindmanager/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MindManager</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.xmind.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">XMind</a>&nbsp;all offer similar-style behavior but are built for other major purposes, such as prototyping or mind mapping.</p><h1>Information Architecture Best Practices</h1><p>While there are few defined rules for what constitutes information architecture, when going through the process, consider the following:</p><h2>Don’t Focus on Hierarchy, Focus on Structure</h2><p><strong>Hierarchy is adjustable</strong>. The homepage will always be the homepage, but where it leads, how users get to those places, and everything in between and beyond is determined later.</p><h2>All Processes Should Be Logical</h2><p>Even though the IA in the UX process is for user interactions, every step of the way has to make sense. Registration screens shouldn’t lead to settings, a camera function shouldn’t jump to a map view…the list goes on.</p><h2>Remember the UX Process</h2><p>A common mistake is to just&nbsp;make&nbsp;IA, without resources, research, or other assets or work. That’s like telling an author to write a book without an outline, or a programmer to code an app without prototypes.</p><h2>You Are the Cartographer</h2><p>Cartographers take everything about a map into consideration, from mountain ranges to state borders. Just like map makers, designers determine what goes into the IA design. Individual pages, specific user behaviors, the context for decision points… and so on.</p><p>Ultimately, the cartographer decides what goes on the map based on user needs. The same is true for designers, so construct the IA for the end-user, namely the product development and design teams.</p><p>To drill the point home once more, all IAs are built for change. Products evolve, designs change, users adapt, and the cycle continues, over and over. Don’t take it too seriously and know that there will always be room for improvement. Don’t aim for perfection; build a simple, adaptable IA.</p><h1>My Information Architecture Is Done… Now What?</h1><p>It’s a common conception that any design work is never&nbsp;truly&nbsp;done, and that’s certainly the case with information architecture. They grow and shrink and change as our products do. Unlike a blueprint for a building, IA will always evolve based on anything from user needs to new features or a product overhaul. Much of the structure may stay the same and provide consistency between versions so users don’t get confused.</p><p>And that’s a good thing. Knowing that IA is a fluid document — one that likely changes weekly, and sometimes even daily — is a powerful way to maintain the overall structure of your app or website without ever touching the code or creating new prototypes. The better the entire product development team&nbsp;knows&nbsp;the IA, the faster everyone will know what is and isn’t possible, and how serious any supposed “easy work” really is.</p><p>This brings us to the real beauty of information architecture: There is no predefined starting point. While the traditional UX design process dictates that the IA is built after completing enough user flows; armed with plenty of user and competitive research, it can also be the first thing done… or the last. The prototyping process often brings up information on how certain behaviors or actions should occur that would be hard to imagine from a logical or unimaginative IA.</p><p>As an ever-evolving practice,&nbsp;<strong>IA design is an art as much as a skill</strong>, which is partly why large corporations have information architect positions. These designers are the gatekeepers of massive systems, and with their understanding of product growth over time, they help drive product, design, and engineering teams to make the right decisions over the span of&nbsp;years. That scale of organization isn’t for all designers, but every designer can build a simple, understandable information architecture.</p><p><br></p>",

Recently launched, Fuud works predominantly with smaller scale farms within BC to source fresh ingredients.</strong></p><p>The current site went live with a minimum viable product model (MVP), so our team of three was tasked with optimizing the site to meet the following goals within our 3 week time limit:</p><ul><li><strong>Increase subscription to the service.</strong></li><li><strong>Allow users to seamlessly browse and select recipes available when subscribing to the meal plan.</strong></li><li><strong>Provide a way for users to share their favourite recipes.</strong></li><li><strong>Increase awareness, highlighting Fuud’s mission and values.</strong></li></ul><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*hFvvJrNZHU1l-qEYyjU-FA.jpeg\"></p><h1>_ Client Kick-off</h1><p><strong>Our first reaction to the Fuud website was that it looked good — a bit daunting to improve something when initially, nothing popped out as not working.&nbsp;</strong>They use fun, colourful graphics and fonts, background videos, and great photograpy. We met with one of the founders to review the goals of the project and to discuss our project scope.</p><p><strong>As Fuud has knowledgable staff in place that could build the proposed redesign, as well as strong branding guidelines in place, we proposed to deliver mid-fi screens, and concentrate our time on research and planning to build out the current MVP.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*NnxQfYfsr1NYlYytPlWKiw.png\"></p><h1>_ Organizational Research</h1><h2>Current Site and User Flow</h2><p>After our meeting, we reviewed all the content of the current site and went through the flow a new user would take to become a member, choose a meal plan and make a purchase.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*z09A2llYKT6TI1LnE6LPbw.png\"></p><p>The great photos stood out, which are shot by one of the founders of Fuud. Not swayed by the pretty pictures, we immediately came across issues.</p><ul><li>Unclear sign up process</li><li>Call to action was confusing</li><li>Hidden navigation on purchase flow pages</li><li>How it Works&nbsp;actually a section on the homepage</li><li>About Us&nbsp;in the footer — frustrations in trying to find more information about Fuud.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*l-mcYgKVri5nSuC5v43j_g.png\"></p><h1>_ Competitive/Comparative Analysis</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*2se92IqoxQ2skEXfFhCpLg.png\"></p><p>We reviewed direct and indirect competitors for: site navigation, content, and suppliers of the products. From this, we planned out the extra info to include in our site redesign, and noted our unique value proposition was&nbsp;<strong>the local and organic farms where the Fuud ingredients come from</strong>.</p><h1>_ Analytics + Hotjar</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/614/1*ZNSiauBMiGqnUvUrdQFCRg.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/212/1*MdWr2jdK8nshamT7u6ZLew.png\"></p><p>Fuud had google analytics and Hotjar accounts set up.&nbsp;<strong>We found users:</strong></p><ul><li>bounced between the homepage and the different meal plan pages. The current site listed 3 plans, so we hypothesized that users probably wanted to review all options (omnivore, veggie and gluten-free).</li><li>didn’t scroll past the hero image; those that did, visited the&nbsp;FAQ&nbsp;and&nbsp;About Us&nbsp;pages.</li></ul><p>Our takeaway’s from the analytics, as well as our experience visiting the site were:</p><ol><li><strong>Unclear navigation, hard to find information.</strong></li><li><strong>Users need more information before making a decision to purchase.</strong></li><li><strong>Users demand further information about the company and want easier access.</strong></li></ol><h1>_ Interviews + Surveys</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*zwSkft1IF5uvoLr67dW-Aw.png\"></p><h2>Prospective</h2><p>Fuud told us their target user was:</p><ul><li>health conscious families / professional couples,&nbsp;<strong>earning over $70k/year.</strong></li><li>support local businesses when they can.</li><li>prefer organic.</li><li>lack the time to meal plan and prep.</li></ul><p>Based on this user, we questioned prospectives on their shopping, cooking and dining out habits,&nbsp;<strong>giving us insight into what people look for when purchasing food.</strong></p><h2>Current</h2><p>While we didn’t get a huge response while contacting existing users, the ones we did talk to had some great insights into the pain points and highlights of the service.&nbsp;<strong>This information was valuable as it really confirmed some of our assumptions about using the site, but also brought to light new issues with the service outside of the website.</strong></p><h2>_ Affinity Diagram</h2><p>Taking our sea of sticky notes to the walls, we mapped our interview findings and survey results, finding the following highlights and pain points:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1298/1*gWojzUEuoHSjX2-IvObjig.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1303/1*muP0bF9guxph4C2ZeLf43Q.png\"></p><h2>FINDINGS</h2><ol><li>We found that the biggest concern for people was&nbsp;<strong>cost,&nbsp;</strong>followed by&nbsp;<strong>quality&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>locality.</strong></li><li>Most cooked at home at least 3 times or more per week, and the main prevention of doing so more was&nbsp;<strong>lack of time</strong>.</li><li><strong>Clarity on the target user.</strong>&nbsp;Our research showed the income of prospective users being $70k + was actually too low, as current users, and prospectives that were more interested in this service had household incomes of $120,000 +.&nbsp;<strong>To investigate this further, the team recommended more interviews and surveying of current users to get a larger sample size and a more accurately defined target user.</strong></li></ol><p><strong>Our research showed that Fuud only saved marginally on cost and time, so highlighting the locality and sourcing of ingredients would be key in making Fuud standout and appeal to those concerned with sustainable, organic and local produce, as well as those wanting to support local small businesses.</strong></p><h1>_ Fuud at home</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*VS8vN_2kFvQoJ3xHGVB1XQ.png\"></p><p>I had been drooling over the Fuud photos, so my favourite bit of research was preparing a meal kit at home. I felt the sense of accomplishment that many of our interview subjects had brought up, however, I also experienced a couple of the pains:</p><ol><li>I misread the whole of the first step in the directions, oops. This didn’t affect the outcome, but I did make note that breaking the instructions into smaller sentences would probably have allieviated this error.</li><li>The instructions didn’t include any pictures of the preparation, and I was unclear on some of the steps or terminology used.</li><li><strong>It took significantly longer than expected</strong>, 25 minutes longer, which was almost twice as long as what the card stated at 30 minutes.</li></ol><h1>_ User Persona</h1><p>We created a persona for a new user to Fuud, Francesca.&nbsp;<strong>This persona was key in understanding the need for a service like Fuud</strong>, and was great for us to really align her struggles with cooking, with what the benefits of Fuud are.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*5o865A6SINhu5UV2QC9L2w.png\"></p><h1>_ Customer Journey Map</h1><p>We created a customer journey map for Francesca, using the pain points and highlights we found in our affinity diagram.&nbsp;<strong>This map uses the current purchase flow of Fuud, allowing us to hone in on the areas of improvement with our redesign.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*vwvYLvJaA50oa8ssZLAXMQ.png\"></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*1JAguGUtBlvYmwASx0LRqA.jpeg\"></p><h1>_ Feature List</h1><p>We all listed ideas for features, moving them around on a chart to decide what was a must, a nice to have, and to kill, finalizing on:</p><ul><li>Meal quantity — choose same menu multiple times.</li><li>Recipe filter.</li><li>Bookmark for favourite recipes.</li><li>Recipe reviews.</li><li>Delivery Options — pick morning or evening.</li><li>Text and email notifications for reminders to pick weekly menu.</li><li>Share options for recipes.</li><li>Live Chat.</li></ul><h1>_ Information Architecture</h1><h2>Navigation Testing</h2><p>First, we reviewed the current site map.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*mmcuQKp4C7oiPudvNGrgwg.png\"></p><p>We then redesigned to included our desired new features. There was some discussion amongst the group as to what wording would be most affective to included on the site, and what would make sense to both new users and returning, so we did some navigation testing.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Gw4vgGrFlNgUuO-3gHddxg.png\"></p><p>Based on our ideas for redesigning the site, we wanted clarity on what words to use, such as MENU versus RECIPE, and ORDER NOW versus GET STARTED. The result was that we went with RECIPE for the archive, and ORDER NOW as the call to action. This was clearer to testers, and made the most sense for returning customers.</p><p><strong>Final Site Map</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*4H23J5mCruIiEmgxud5G8A.png\"></p><h1>_ Purchase Flow</h1><p>With our redesign, we recreated the purchase flow for ordering meals.</p><p><strong>For a better user experience, our flow was longer than the original, but we felt that this offered more information and clarity for the user, allowing more options that improved on the pain points from existing users.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*NWG77KZWrRyUKSCT-M1PHg.png\"></p><p>We eliminated the current diet plans, and instead began by selecting the # of meals per week and quantity.</p><p>We then:</p><ul><li>added a recipe filter;</li><li>added more delivery time options;</li><li>added option to pick up from the warehouse, allowing apartment dwellers, or those working weekends the option to order;</li><li>added option to set re-ordering reminders to address pain point of forgetting to submit choices; and</li><li>added detailed order review and confirmation pages.</li></ul><p>A more detailed user flow for our persona, Francesca, includes the decisions that need to be made to go ahead with purchasing. We included all information based pages in the main navigation for easier access and more clarity.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*0voFMTwdd9-1WUlZs0MlKg.png\"></p><p><strong>These flows really helped us empathize with how people used the site, and aided in the storytelling aspect of our homepage, helping us to understand what information we needed to include and why.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Q1OXWWkxFelMzBDzv22U8w.jpeg\"></p><h1>_ Design Studio</h1><p>We began with design studio, taking a mobile first approach as per our analytics. Starting with the homepage, we drafted a few versions, then discussed our design. We were closely aligned with the content we wanted to include, and the story we wanted to tell, highlighting the people and suppliers behind Fuud and showcasing their dedication to sustainability and supporting small business.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2448/1*nXEGWlMjT-pvwuH-G3Kolg.jpeg\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2448/1*k9RILhgD4T-GPyhFONv9hw.jpeg\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2448/1*px9-kLkAbubSi0oThkXEeA.jpeg\"></p><p>From there, we began wire framing pages in Sketch, splitting up screens between the team, working with the same template, and using the existing fonts.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*4qkKO5AcaEPVbE1g_XGxhg.png\"></p><p>Sample mobile screens</p><p>We added a filter, allowing users to see all recipes, and changed the cooking time to a bar, selecting a range of time rather. We also recommended to the clients to change the cook time on the printed recipe cards to a range of time rather than a specific number — allowing for different prep speeds and alleviating this pain point.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/417/1*5peH3lkanJDiCC-2yT2nZg.png\"></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/350/1*A-XAMKTsJHg5okLA4TTctA.png\"></p><h1>_ Email Communication</h1><p>One pain point we received from all the current users we talked to was remembering to make your meal selection before the cut off.</p><p>We looked at the reminder email that was sent out, and at first, we missed the reminder altogether. The reminder was sent within the newsletter, with a subject line unrelated to the task, and the reminder itself was a small single line of text, and the call to action didn’t stand out.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*7QfhEQdBxjCrTfbPXkeKpg.png\"></p><p>Proposed reminder email</p><p>We proposed a separate reminder email with a clear subject line and large image with a prompt to pick the meals, and a button reiterating the call to&nbsp;<strong>Select Now</strong>, rather than the previous&nbsp;<strong>Let’s Get Cookin’.</strong></p><p>We then looked at the confirmation email and redesigned it to include the actual delivery and order details, rather than having the user sign in.&nbsp;<strong>This again, was a more user friendly approach and served more purpose than the original.</strong></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*gUM4AplEX3xDRJLaeRjUbg.png\"></p><p>Proposed confirmation email</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*RzfXql66F8O1AWWLbnWHfw.jpeg\"></p><p>We tested and the purchase flow numerous times, making iterations based on our results. We found that:</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*QENUsP-N18W7QrodXYNOqA.png\"></p><ul><li>The naming of the checkout steps created confusion, so we renamed, and took the words out of the progress bar.</li><li>The plans name created confusion, so we renamed to highlight the number of people they are for.</li><li>The filter button was too subtle — so we changed the style and position.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*9EZ8CFw01-tdIrHYo2gPUw.png\"></p><ul><li>The order review was combined with the payment info screen, which people didnt see as they clicked the submit order right away. We separated the review, adding an extra step on the order process, but allowing clarity for the user.</li><li>We added the ability to edit options.</li><li>The order confirmation message was not explicit enough — we deresigned and added an icon.</li><li>The “order status” was at the bottom of the page, most users missed this part — so we reordered.</li><li>Added the recipe selection alert options.</li></ul><p>To the homepage, we reiterated our original design to make the content clearer and to include more information for the visitors to better meet the business goals.</p><p>We added discount promo bar at top of the homepage to entice first time users, (previously, it was in the footer), then added the&nbsp;<strong>Peace of Mind</strong>&nbsp;section to highlight commitment to locally sourced ingredients, and made a separate page for&nbsp;<strong>How it Works</strong>&nbsp;to give potential users more information.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*cboTTRfUwP4lTtgyweBe8g.jpeg\"></p><p>Working with Fuud was different than the other projects, in that we got to decide how we wanted to proceed to meet our client goals. This was a welcomed challenge. We made the call early on to focus on a research-heavy process and optimize not just the website, but the actual flow for a user, from finding the site to ongoing communication with Fuud.</p><h1>_Project Takeaways</h1><p>One of my biggest takeaways, moreso than previous projects, was how design really can affect a users experience.<strong>&nbsp;I realized that for years as a graphic designer, I was guilty of making the same mistake Fuud had in their email design, choosing something I thought looked good over something that functioned to communicate the message.</strong></p><p>As well, something as simple as breaking down instructions into short points rather than a paragraph, and including visuals, really elevated the overall experience for the user, and eliminated those minor irritations that cause a negative experience.</p><p>Another key takeaway was that&nbsp;<strong>adding content or steps to a flow was okay,&nbsp;</strong>and can enhance a users experience. Too often in UX, we are concerned about simplifying existing processes and making tasks as short as possible. We realized with our redesign that including more relevant information and adding an extra step or two, allowed people to more readily make the decision to sign up, and to have a more enjoyable experience doing so.</p><h1>_ Prototype</h1><p><br></p>",

We’ll cover all the essential features that affect design, responsive auto layouts, components and design systems, as well as prototyping and developer handoff.</p><p>In a Figma vs. Adobe XD showdown, who comes out ahead?</p><p>Let’s take a look.</p><h1>What is Figma?</h1><p>Figma is a vector interface design and prototyping tool that is primarily browser-based, with a desktop app available for macOS and Windows. In recent years, Figma has quickly become one of the most popular UX design tools, thanks to its intuitive interface, comprehensive feature set, and rich collaboration features.</p><p><br></p><p>With a robust free tier that’s perfect for individuals and small teams, Figma is an easy choice for UX/UI designers who are looking for a tool that is easily adaptable to their design flow.</p><p><em>You can read our in-depth&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/ux-designer-guide-to-figma/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Figma review here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h1>What is Adobe XD?</h1><p>Adobe XD is a vector-based design tool that’s mainly used for designing user interfaces (UI) for mobile and web applications. While the team at Adobe has been rapidly deploying new features for this tool, it remains fairly lightweight when compared with other Adobe products like Photoshop or Illustrator. For interface designers interested in rapid design and prototyping iterations, lightweight isn’t a bad thing.</p><p><br></p><p>In its early years, Adobe XD offered a free version as well. However, that is being phased out in favor of a 7-day free trial, followed by a paid subscription.</p><p><em>You can read our in-depth&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/ux-designer-guide-to-adobe-xd/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Adobe XD review here</em></a><em>.</em></p><h1>Figma vs Adobe XD: Features Comparison</h1><p>At a first glance, the Figma vs Adobe XD showdown seems fairly similar. So let’s dive into some of the specific features, and how the subtle (or not-so-subtle) differences might help you decide which UX/UI design tool will best suit your design needs.</p><p><br></p><h1>Supported Platforms</h1><p>One of the most obvious differences between Figma and Adobe XD is that Figma is primarily a web-based program, while Adobe XD is designed to work locally as a desktop app.</p><p><br></p><p>This means that Figma can be used on any platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux), as long as you’re connected to the internet. You can design in the browser itself, or download a desktop app. Keep in mind that, while you can use the desktop app offline, you’ll want to make sure you’re connected to the internet for full access to all of Figma’s features.</p><p>Adobe XD, on the other hand, was created primarily as a desktop app that is currently available for Windows and macOS users. However, all of the collaboration features are reliant on an online connection that will let you save your files to Creative Cloud. If you do want to change a local file to the Cloud (or vice versa), you’ll have to create a “Save as” version of the file in the new location. While this is a minor step, it does require a quick check to make sure that the old file is deleted, to avoid confusion further on about which file is the most up to date.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong></p><p>Tie. Both tools offer desktop apps, and require you to be online to take advantage of the full feature set.</p><h1>Interface</h1><p>Log into either tool and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how similar the interfaces are, with minimal toolbars along the left and top, and a more detailed panel on the right that changes based on what you’re currently working on. If you’re currently using text, for example, the right hand panel will give you your font, color, spacing, and other options. But as soon as you switch it to the pen or shape tool, the options will change to correspond with that particular tool.</p><p><br></p><p>In Figma, you’ll spend the majority of your time working from the top toolbar, with the left sidebar reserved for organizing layers and reusable assets, called&nbsp;<strong>components</strong>.</p><p>In Adobe XD, all your design tools are found in the left sidebar, whether you’re looking for document assets, UI kits, or are simply creating your work from scratch with shapes and the pen tool.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong></p><p>If you tend to do a lot of back-and-forth work with your layers (or are working with complex designs), you might enjoy the way you can keep them front and center with Figma.</p><p>However, Adobe XD’s concept of keeping all design tools in one place makes the interface slightly more intuitive and easy to use.</p><h1>Design and Layout Tools</h1><p>Both Figma and Adobe XD offer a wide range of design tools, including vector drawing with a pen tool, shape tools, text, and various color and effects options.</p><p><br></p><p>This is where Figma really stands out, with vector drawing options that are extremely flexible and remain fully customizable.</p><p>Let’s take a cube, for example:</p><p>In Figma, you can simply use the pen tool to draw the lines of a cube to create a compound vector shape that can be customized as needed.</p><p>In Adobe XD, you’ll still use the pen tool to create the cube, but with a caveat: each vector point can only be connected once. To create a moveable shape, you’ll either move the lines into a group, or perform a complex Boolean operation to merge the lines into a single element.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong></p><p>Figma is the clear winner in this category, with more flexible vector design tools that can create complex shapes and elements without requiring Boolean operations.</p><h1>Responsive Design</h1><p>Adobe XD and Figma both support a design process that encompasses desktop and mobile app design-and, more importantly: responsive interfaces.</p><p><br></p><p>When using Figma, you’ll find the&nbsp;<strong>Auto layout</strong>&nbsp;tool invaluable. Auto layout is a property that you can apply to elements, frames, and components that will designate how they grow, shrink, or otherwise behave as their contents change.</p><p>For example, you can use Auto layout to design versatile buttons that will expand or decrease automatically based on how much text you add to the label. You can also combine various frames to create full interface designs that illustrate exactly how the elements should behave, based on screen size.</p><p>Auto layout gives you control over vertical and horizontal padding, padding between items, as well as independent padding control (so you can have more padding on the left and top, for example, and less on the right and bottom). It also lets you decide whether you want strokes included in the layout (versus sitting outside them), and the stacking order.</p><p>Adobe XD’s equivalent is called&nbsp;<strong>Responsive Resize</strong>, which is automatically applied to each component that you create in your design project.</p><p>While the auto settings can be adequate for simple designs, you might find yourself gravitating towards the manual options to designate where you want an item to be anchored (left, top, right, bottom, or a mix of two) as well as if it should have a fixed height or width.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong></p><p>Figma is the clear winner in this category, with its Auto layout feature that allows designers to create responsive interfaces that can shrink or scale following a set of rules.</p><h1>Creating and Managing Design Systems</h1><p>Whether you’re working on a single client project as a UX design freelancer, or are a part of an in-house design team, having a design system that’s fully integrated in your workspace can save time and energy.</p><p><br></p><p>At a basic level, design systems include a color palette and font styles, but for UX/UI designers, they also include UI elements like cards, buttons, and other styles that can be reused within your project.</p><p>You can create design systems that are local to each of your Figma files by global styles for colors, fonts, and other attributes which can be easily applied to different components. Or, you can go a step further when part of a Team in Figma. Within each team, you can create a dedicated design system file, which houses all of your global styles. These styles can then be pulled into the different design files for that team.</p><p>With Adobe XD, you have the same options to create color palettes, font styles, and components. However, if you’d like to share your design system with a team at large, you’ll want to publish the assets as a Creative Cloud&nbsp;<strong>Library</strong>.</p><p>Here, the Adobe ecosystem really pulls its weight, since you can utilize Creative Cloud libraries saved from other programs like Photoshop, which makes it much easier to ensure that all your design files are always pulling the latest design elements.</p><p><em>Learn more about how you can uplevel your design systems in Adobe XD in this webinar…</em></p><p><strong>Winner:</strong></p><p>Adobe XD. While Figma’s components and design system are perfectly usable, they remain limited to the Figma app. Adobe XD opens up new collaboration and organization possibilities between your various design programs, all centralized in Creative Cloud.</p><h1>Collaboration and Sharing</h1><p>As a web based design app, Figma is built with team collaboration front and center. Each project serves as its own hub, with an at-a-glance look at who has access to the project and when a file was last updated.</p><p><br></p><p>Once inside the file, you can design in real time with your teammates, follow someone’s cursor, and leave comments/threaded replies within the file. Worried about version control? You can utilize the file history to see who changed what, and to revert back to an earlier version, if necessary.</p><p>Adobe XD offers collaboration features when you save your design file in the Cloud. We’ve already mentioned the ease of using Libraries, but you can also coedit in real time with anyone who you’ve invited to the design file. If you’re looking primarily for comments and feedback, you can use the share option to create a link that can be viewed in a browser. Comments can then be edited, resolved, or simply deleted.</p><p>The share links are where Adobe XD truly stands out, since you can create multiple share links depending on whether you need the viewer to review and leave comments, review the design specs, or simply watch in presentation mode.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong></p><p>Tie. Figma’s real time collaboration features stand out for teams who don’t want to have to re-invite each designer individually for every file and are looking for a streamlined experience of being able to see the design specs within the file itself. However, Adobe XD’s customizable share links are incredibly helpful for delivering the correct view to each stakeholder or team member, without accidentally giving them too much (or too little) access.</p><h1>Developer Handoff</h1><p>Both Figma and Adobe XD include design specs for CSS, iOS, and Android.</p><p><br></p><p>With Figma, the developer(s) can hop straight inside the design file to inspect individual elements, layers, components, and the interactions that are set up in prototyping mode. Any auto layout settings will also appear in the developer’s inspect panel.</p><p>With Adobe XD, the code is not visible within the app interface. Instead, you’ll want to go to&nbsp;<strong>Share &gt; Development</strong>, and select the&nbsp;<strong>Export for Web</strong>&nbsp;to generate the CSS code. This will generate a shareable link that you can then access in the browser and inspect each component to uncover the CSS code.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong></p><p>Figma. The handoff specs are much more robust and easier to use within the design file as a whole, making it easier for developers to gain a more holistic understanding of how your design is intended to function.</p><h1>Pricing</h1><p>Figma offers a free plan for individuals and small teams, with a Professional plan that starts at $12/editor per month.</p><p><br></p><p>Adobe XD offers a free 7-day trial, paid plans starting at $9.99 per month for the standalone app subscription.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong></p><p>Tie. While Figma’s free version stands out, their paid plans start at a higher cost per month than Adobe XD.</p><h1>Takeaway: Should You Use Figma or Adobe XD?</h1><p>Figma and Adobe XD are both incredible user experience design tools, which offer a full suite of features that take you from the initial wireframe through design prototyping and hand off to developers.</p><p><br></p><p>You might gravitate towards Figma if …</p><ul><li>You often want to collaborate within a design file</li><li>You prefer a browser based design tool</li><li>You want to offer quick access to prototypes for review or testing purposes</li><li>You are looking for more flexibility in your vector design graphics</li></ul><p>You might gravitate towards Adobe XD if…</p><ul><li>You want to stay within the Creative Cloud ecosystem</li><li>You prefer a desktop app to a web based program</li><li>You don’t mind paying a per month (or per year) subscription</li></ul>",

It can be distressing learning about all of the dark patterns that are commonly used in the world of UX, and whilst it is fascinating and entertaining to learn about dark psychology, it is equally as important for us as designers to recognise these methods to ensure that we are providing our users with an ethical experience, aimed at their benefit, not our profit.</p><h1>Steal like an Artist</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*4LDXXHosLRwZ6m8TepIo0Q.jpeg\"></p><p>Steal Like an Artist is a fantastic book that explores creativity in the digital era, arguing that no creation is original, and the true masters of crafts come from those who accept inspiration and influence freely rather than reject it out of fear of lacking originality.</p><p>As UX Designers it’s important for us to collect and gather unique, effective and inspirational thoughts and designs that we see around us everyday — Sure they might not alway be applicable to the projects we’re working on, but with the massive influx in apps, content and ideas daily in the modern age, it’s almost a guarantee that we’ll find something that can be used to help us improve a feature or design that we’re working on.</p><p>There’s so many more, and much better articulated ideas within this book, and I definitely recommend picking it up as it’s also quite a rapid read!</p><h1>Design for the Real World: Human Ecology &amp; Social Change</h1><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*jp3Pem-bXyAWw3Za11Ofbg.jpeg\"></p><p>Written in 1972 yet still in many cases unfortunately just as applicable in the 21st century, Design for the Real World is a must read for not only UX Designers, but any designer full stop.</p><p>This book helped lay the foundations for the humanitarian design movement that emerged in the 80s, targeting the roots of wasteful, harmful and environmentally unfriendly design that remain in place today, detached from the everyday lives of people, andis a fantastic primer for thought.</p><p>One of Papaneks pieces of advice for designers that I found interesting, holds true today, stating that a designer would move to a specific part of a country in which they are working in, and become a ‘seed’ of sorts training other designers to create within this particular population group, which we can learn a huge deal from as UX Designers as we aim to serve our own core demographics better, rather than giving them generic experiences (of course, you may not want to move country entirely, but the idea here is what’s important).</p><h1>In Summary</h1><p>It’s impossible to cut down my favourite UX books into just 3, there’s just too much quality work out there, but hopefully after reading through this I’ve given you some interesting and insightful reads to add to your library that may give you some lightbulb moments as they did for me!</p><p><br></p><p>Every booklist I write for UX, I find myself wanting to talk about so many more; and I plan to! Drop a follow if you found this article interesting and want to learn more about UX, or engage with me in some interesting experience design exploration!</p>",

      "body": "<p>Art is subjective. And yes, beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. However, if you’ve encountered a confusing parking sign or a website from the early 90s, you’ll know that poor design exists.</p><p>Like any other profession, graphic design also has rigid guidelines that function beneath the surface to harmonize and balance the work. Understanding design principles and how they interplay is crucial for both emerging and senior designers. Consciously implementing them is the secret to producing aesthetically pleasing and practical designs.</p><p>When I started as a designer, I didn’t fully understand these principles to be able to leverage them in my designs. However, with time I got acquainted and began to understand what works and, most importantly, why it works.</p><p>In this article, we’ll look at each principle individually and understand how they interact to help you reach the targeted audience with the right message.</p><h2>What are Design Principles?</h2><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*aIv4zXgQWqbhavS0nbDb7Q.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Design Principles, Image Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skh.design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skh.design</a></p><p>In a nutshell, design principles are rules, behavioural patterns, and considerations to judiciously employ in your designs to minimize users’ cognitive loads and increase appeal. Experts from various disciplines, including behavioural science, sociology, ergonomics, psychology, etc., laid the groundwork for these design principles. They are a representation of the collective knowledge of design pundits and researchers.</p><h2>How are these principles important for your designs?</h2><p>Design and usability expert Jared Spool says, “good design, when it’s done well, becomes invisible. It’s only when it’s done poorly that we notice it.” And for this reason alone, good design is difficult to define.</p><p><br></p><p>As a designer, you must’ve had moments when you’re about to tear off your hair because something is off in your design, but you can’t put your finger on it. Design principles help you fix this problem and many others throughout the design process by assisting you in determining the core values of your product so that you can make decisions that respect the integrity of those values. And if you and your team have a few sets of protocols to return to, you will naturally have a shared vocabulary and set of standards you can leverage while working together.</p><h1>Six Core Design Principles</h1><p>While researching for this article, I found a book called Universal Principles of Design by William Lidwell, Jill Butler, and Kritina Holden. It has a comprehensive collection of 125 concepts(or principles) relevant to your everyday design process. But out of 125, I believe these six form the foundational principles of a good design.</p><p><br></p><h2>1. Accessibility</h2><p>Commonly known as&nbsp;<strong>barrier-free design</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>Let us talk about the elevator in my building to give you an example of an accessible design. It has wide doors that make it simple to enter, a couple of handrails on either side that help people take support, and two sets of controls that are reachable from a seated position. Additionally, the floor numbers are redundantly coded with numbers, icons, and Braille, and feedback is given visually and audibly. Also, it has an emergency phone system that provides access to specialized assistance.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*uSknZ4crqHUHW5Uj5u8J8g.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Accessibility in Design, Image Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skh.design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skh.design</a></p><p>By referring to the above example, an ideal accessible design should have four qualities: perceptibility, operability, simplicity, and forgiveness.</p><ul><li><strong>Perceptibility</strong>&nbsp;— is when a design is perceivable by everyone, regardless of sensory capabilities.</li><li><strong>Operability&nbsp;</strong>— is when a design is usable by everyone, regardless of physical capabilities.</li><li><strong>Simplicity</strong>&nbsp;— is when any person, regardless of expertise, literacy, or degree of focus, can readily grasp and use a design.</li><li><strong>Forgiveness —&nbsp;</strong>is when a design reduces the likelihood and effects of errors.</li></ul><p>Designs must be useable by individuals of all abilities without needing specific modifications. The goal of accessibility in design has always been to accommodate those with impairments. But later, it became more evident that many necessary accommodations we can make to benefit everyone.</p><h2>2. Emphasis</h2><p>Emphasis causes some parts of the design to stand out. Conversely, it can also be used to minimize the degree of prominence of some elements. We use this principle to communicate information in our everyday life. Imagine a public speaker giving a speech without emphasizing certain words. The audience won’t be able to comprehend the message the speaker is trying to communicate.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*L6aY5fOa5yMfIw-58jiPuA.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Emphasis in Design, Image Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skh.design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skh.design</a></p><p>In the same way, emphasis is a design feature that draws the user’s attention. In other words, it is a centrepiece. Whether it’s the headline, a picture, or a Call-to-Action(CTA), this should ideally be the most essential design section. Sometimes designers mistakenly emphasize the wrong website elements, leading to user confusion.</p><p>Users should easily find necessary action or vital information to complete a task. As you examine your user journey, you should ask yourself, how am I making it easy for users to complete the tasks they need to do? This might involve adjusting your design’s navigation based on the results of any usability studies you conduct. If someone isn’t finding a critical feature quickly during the study, you want to find a better way to emphasize it.</p><h2>3. Whitespace</h2><p>The rest of the design principles all relate to the elements you include in your work. White space is the only one that expressly addresses what you don’t contribute.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*KRrzfo-QgQVp3kOpi__U2A.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Whitespace in Design, Image Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skh.design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skh.design</a></p><p>White space refers to spaces in a design devoid of visual features and spaces with underused space around those items. More specifically, it refers to the voids, open spaces, and locations in your design where nothing is present. White space emphasizes a more straightforward design approach by not adding any features to the composition. Indeed, less is more.</p><p>It is a common misconception that white space has to be white. Well, not necessarily. It can be of any colour.</p><h2>4. Hierarchy</h2><p>Hierarchy is a visual design principle that arranges elements on a page in order of their priority.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, you might be wondering how hierarchy is different from emphasis. Although both are related concepts, hierarchy refers to a group of elements organized in order of importance. On the other hand, emphasis is about making one element stand out from other elements.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*FMF2TzGAhLZMTPYHbz8yNg.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Hierarchy in Design, Image Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skh.design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skh.design</a></p><p>Why do we need a hierarchy? Visual hierarchy is an essential aspect of effective design because everything on your website appears to be of equal value if nothing is essential. In UX design, we always want to clarify to the user where to focus first and what action to take by giving visual clues. Hierarchy helps point users to the first step they should take in their user journey.</p><h2>5. Contrast</h2><p>When two or more design components are near one another, the contrast plays a prominent, noticeable function in their degree of difference.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*aWBf6K39AWJlc3YBhZoQ9w.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Contrast in Design, Image Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skh.design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skh.design</a></p><p>Although when you hear contrast, only the colour contrast is the first thing that comes to mind. But you can show contrast in your designs by differences in element sizes, shapes, or other characteristics.</p><h2>6. Alignment</h2><p>Alignment describes how visual components are positioned, arranged, and organized relative to one another and the overall design. It is a technique for visually linking similar elements to make the design look more cohesive. Aligning various visual elements aids in directing the observer through the design.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*1yod5awaDinXO9Niyymosw.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>Alignment in Design, Image Credit:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.skh.design/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">skh.design</a></p><p>For example, left- and right-aligned text blocks in paragraph text offer stronger alignment clues than centres-aligned text blocks. Left- and right-aligned text blocks produce an invisible column that is an apparent visual reference for the placement of other design components. Contrarily, centre-aligned text blocks offer more ambiguous visual alignment cues and may be challenging to connect with other elements.</p><p>Although rows and columns are the most common way to establish alignment, other, more intricate types of alignment do exist. For example, when aligning pieces diagonally, the relative angles between the unseen alignment lines should be at least 30 degrees apart; any difference at all less than that is too undetectable and too faint.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>When I was first introduced to these principles, being the rebel I was, I wondered, can we make do without these principles? I think design is an abstract art form, and we’re limiting our vision by following only a few rules. But with time, I learned structured creative direction always trumps abstract art compared to usability or comprehension metrics. Designing something that genuinely looks nice and provides the best user experience is usually done by the designer’s intuition and may require a lot of trial and error.</p>",

It’s a visual resume that can not only help you land your first job in the field of UX/UI design, but also grow and uplevel your career trajectory.</p><p>So how is it possible for a new UX Designer to land a job when competing with other professionals who have more extensive portfolios full of big name case studies and flashy designs?</p><p>Surprisingly … It happens a lot.</p><p>Many emerging UX designers from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.trydesignlab.com/uxplanet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">UX Academy</a>&nbsp;go on to land amazing UX jobs — from junior to senior level — from portfolios that “only” consist of student projects.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn what a UX portfolio is, why it’s important, and what to include (and perhaps more importantly: what to cut out).</p><p>We’ll also share some self-editing tips that will help your portfolio website stand out from the crowd and showcase your abilities to the highest extent, whether you’re already an experienced, seasoned designer, or are just emerging into the field.</p><h1>What is a UX Design Portfolio?</h1><p>A UX design portfolio is a collection of design case studies that showcases your approach to the design process as a whole.</p><p><br></p><p>Typically, most people choose to build their portfolio in the form of a website as an additional layer of proof that they understand how to create effective digital interfaces and flows.</p><p>This portfolio is then shared as part of the job interview process, so potential employers can see detailed examples of how you approach various challenges in UX design, problem solving, understanding users, research, storytelling, and perhaps most importantly, your ability to empathize with the user journey.</p><h1>Why is a UX Design Portfolio Important?</h1><p>Your portfolio plays a major role in the interview cadence for most UX/UI design positions. It’s so important, in fact, that applications can be moved forward or ignored based on a quick glance through the portfolio.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/janelle-academia-product-design-career-change/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Janelle Academia</a>, a recent graduate of UX Academy, shared her experience of just how important a UX design portfolio website can be:</p><blockquote>The CEO of Carry actually let me know that even though I didn’t have previous design experience, he was so impressed by the work in my portfolio that he decided to learn more about me.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>She was eventually offered the job!</p><h1>How to Build Your First UX Portfolio (Without Prior Design Experience)</h1><p>If you’ve never had a UX design job, there are two categories of work you can create and put into a portfolio: You can make your own redesigns of websites and apps, and you can design originals.</p><p><br></p><p>If you want to work on a redesign and make it worthy of a portfolio, you’ll need to work on it as if you were assigned it in a job. It must have strong concepts behind it, as well as top-notch aesthetics. You should:</p><ul><li>Solve a problem that’s affecting the user experience and hurting the business.</li><li>Interview users, perhaps getting your friends and family to test the website or app, asking them questions — and/or read comments about it online.</li><li>Write out several concepts of how to improve it and explain the pros and cons of each.</li><li>Mock up your best ideas into designs that look great.</li></ul><p>When you have made several thoughtful and research-driven designs, you can package them together into one portfolio website, PDF, or even a physical folder. But keep in mind that your projects have to look as beautiful as possible, as well as having powerful reasoning to back them up, if you want an employer to make an investment in you and risk their business’s future on your design abilities.</p><p><em>Your portfolio is your very own little corner of the internet and, in our competitive UX/UI design industry, it’s crucial to make the most of this space. In this webinar and interview, Kelly shares her top tips for crafting an effective design portfolio.</em></p><p><br></p><h1>11 Elements to Include In Your UX Portfolio</h1><p>If you have several projects to show off — whether your own practice projects or some paid work — you should sit down and go through them all to decide what to put in your UX portfolio. Ask these questions:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>What parts of the UX design process do I enjoy the most?</li><li>What makes me different from other UX designers?</li><li>What types of projects do I appear best at?</li><li>Which projects taught me the most?</li><li>What projects did I add the most value to?</li><li>Are there engaging stories behind any of these pieces?</li></ul><p>Pick projects based on your answers, as well as the type of job you’re applying to. These answers might even help you decide on the direction you want your career to head in.</p><p>Additionally, here are eleven other elements that you will likely want to incorporate:</p><h2>1. Include Your Elevator Pitch</h2><p>The design of your portfolio itself is a prime opportunity for you, as a UX designer, to demonstrate that you know what good UX means.</p><p>This is more than just having engaging visuals: it’s about organizing information in a way that accommodates the needs of your portfolio’s users (i.e. potential employers or clients). One of the first key tests of a portfolio is whether someone can look at your site for just 5 seconds and understand what it is that you do.</p><h2>2. Showcase Your Best Work</h2><p>Before including a project or case study in your UX design portfolio, ask yourself honestly: what score out of 10 would I give this project? If you’d give it an 8 or below, consider either leaving it out, or doing some more work to polish it up. Sometimes the extra work is purely presentational, and can be done quickly. Other times, you might want to spend more time digging back into the project, for example, to tighten up your screen designs.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s always better to show a few excellent projects (aim for 3–6), rather than many case studies of variable quality.</p><p>Remember: a hiring manager might come to your site, click a random case study, and form their opinion based on that project alone. For each one, ask yourself: would I be happy for my work to be judged on the basis of this case study alone?</p><p><em>Don’t forget that your portfolio website is only one place to showcase your work. You can also share other projects that don’t make the cut on other platforms. Try Dribbble, Instagram, or your blog to showcase other work that you’d like to have people see, but isn’t necessarily a priority.</em></p><h2>3. Demonstrate How You Solve Problems</h2><p>Everyone loves beautiful visuals and stunning mockups — but hiring managers need to see more than just the end result from a case study. They’re looking for evidence of your abilities to analyze and define a problem, follow a logical process of research and ideation, and develop a solution that is realistic and meets both business and user needs.</p><p><br></p><p>You can demonstrate these skills by including images or videos of your process, and by including a carefully written narrative with each project that explains how the project progressed. This can mean quite a lot of extra effort, but doing so means that potential employers can see your ability to handle projects end-to-end.</p><h2>4. Your Personal Bio</h2><p>Hiring managers want to rapidly find out about two things: your work, and your skills background. So make sure that your personal bio is easy to find. It could be on the homepage, or on a clearly-labeled “About me” page that can be accessed from the main navigation.</p><p>The best personal bios are short and focused — a single brief paragraph is enough. Aim to include something about your skills, your values, and your vision as a designer. ‘</p><h2>5. Contact Info</h2><p>Once you’ve successfully piqued the interest of a hiring manager, recruiter, or potential client, they’ll probably want to get in touch. Make this step as easy as possible!</p><p><br></p><p>You could have a “contact me” button in the main navigation, a simple contact form, or you could even just include your email address on each page.</p><h2>6. Other Links to Include</h2><p>Although a UX designer’s portfolio is still their most important asset, it’s a good decision to also include links to your resume, LinkedIn profile, and even social media, if applicable.</p><p><br></p><p>Many UX designers use Instagram or Dribbble as an extension of their portfolio, often using the platform to show work-in-progress, notes, sketches, and experiments.</p><p>Including links to your LinkedIn profile, and a downloadable PDF resume, can also help to remove barriers that might prevent people from following up or contacting you further down the line.</p><h2>7. Usability</h2><p>It’s tempting to make a strong statement through the visual design of your portfolio website pages. There’s nothing wrong with that, but remember that the primary purpose of the portfolio is to present the story behind your case studies and allow people to find the information they need quickly and efficiently.</p><p><br></p><p>So, for example, avoid experimental navigation that might frustrate the user in reaching those goals, and don’t create a portfolio design that’s so elaborate that it outshines the work you’re presenting.</p><h2>8. How To Include Bonus Projects (If You Have Them)</h2><p>UX designers are often highly creative people, and the chances are you have a lot more awesome projects going on than the few you are professionally showcasing in your official portfolio. It’s great to include “bonus” projects that help people to connect with your passion and with who you are as a designer.</p><p><br></p><p>This could simply be other self-started UX design projects, or it could be complementary skills like writing, photography, illustration — you name it! The key is for any extra content you include to be something you’re proud of and enthusiastic about.</p><p>If you have training in both print and digital design, but only want to work on websites, don’t highlight your print work. Avoid including work that misleads a viewer to what type of projects you’d like to work on in the future.</p><h2>9. Incorporate Visual Design and Brand Style</h2><p>Whether or not you create a logo or use unique typography for yourself, you should always have a brand and personal style. Your brand is the sum total of the presentational choices you make — so make those choices mindfully, and make them meaningful. Even just setting your name in simple text, rather than creating a monogram, can say something about your approach to design solutions: perhaps you favor simplicity and clarity over decoration.</p><p><br></p><p>Whatever decisions you make here (including fonts, colors, images, and tone of voice), remember that they represent you both as a designer and as a person. You need to be comfortable with the messages your branding conveys, and that those messages are in tune with the work you present.</p><h2>10. Tell a Story with Your Portfolio Website</h2><p>If you’re applying to lots of junior positions in big organizations, hiring managers probably have to get through hundreds of applications on a regular basis. Be thoughtful about their needs — and how you can stand out to that person by making their job easier and more delightful.</p><p><br></p><p>Show how you are thoughtful as a designer: you can do this by transforming each of your portfolio pieces into a compelling story, rather than just a collection of images. Your portfolio is your best marketing tool. It’s your visual resume. When someone looks at a resume, they typically only glance it over, and the same is true for a portfolio. You only have so much time to convey who you are and what you do, so get specific.</p><h2>11. Be Specific About Your Role in Each Project</h2><p>If the project was part of a collaboration, it’s a huge red flag if other project contributors aren’t mentioned. Clearly describe your role and properly credit and link to other people on the project team.</p><p><br></p><h1>Takeaway</h1><p>An employer is making an investment when they hire you, putting tens of thousands of dollars into an employment package. It makes sense, then, to put your time and energy into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://designlab.com/blog/10-ux-ui-design-portfolios/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">creating a UX portfolio that stands out</a>, which shows them you have the ability to make their investment worthwhile.</p><p><br></p><p>While you might have to eliminate some of your favorite projects to get specific, don’t forget to personalize. Your bio and any other content on your site should create a clear and concise overview of who you are and the type of work you excel at. While the best portfolio sites let the work speak for itself, your personality can also shine through in your personal branding, copywriting and any other Easter eggs you choose to include.</p>",

Are you ready for yours? Let’s get started!</p><h1><strong>1. What Does a UX Designer Do?</strong></h1><p>Firstly when we see The term&nbsp;<strong>“user experience” (or UX)</strong>&nbsp;it describes the interaction a person has with a product or service. hence&nbsp;<strong>User experience (UX) designers</strong>&nbsp;work to optimize the interaction between humans and products.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*cTuPL_FXuTQ9_IO4JQfpCA.jpeg\"></p><p>A user experience occurs whenever you interact with a product or service. This could include navigating a mobile app, browsing a website, interacting with a physical product (such as trying on a new running shoe), or using a service (checking into a hotel or using public transportation for example).</p><p>A UX designer also creates digital products in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.figma.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Figma</strong></a>&nbsp;that are simple and enjoyable to use, such as websites, apps, and software programs. Their overall goal is to keep their platform clean, simple, and simple to use for regular users.</p><p><strong>UX designer tasks and responsibilities</strong></p><p>As a user experience designer, you are responsible for the overall satisfaction of a product’s users. Consider yourself the customer’s advocate, constantly on the lookout for ways to improve the customer’s experience. Let’s go over some of the tasks and responsibilities you’ll most likely encounter during the design process.</p><p><strong>1. Learn about the user and the brand</strong>. Consider the problem you’re attempting to solve for the user (and how this aligns with brand goals).</p><p><strong>2. Conduct user testing.</strong>&nbsp;Determine the user’s needs, goals, behaviors, and pain points. Surveys, one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and A/B testing are examples of user research tools. In some companies, this process is led by a UX researcher.</p><p><strong>3. Examine what you’ve discovered.&nbsp;</strong>You’ll create user personas based on your research at this point to help you identify the most important aspects of the product or service. Begin by sketching out the user flow.</p><p><strong>4. Design</strong>. You’ll create site maps, wireframes, or prototypes as you start to flesh out the design to give you and your team a better idea of what the final product will look like. A user interface (UI) designer will add visual or interface elements at this stage.</p><p><strong>5. Perform user testing.</strong>&nbsp;Track how real users interact with the product or service to validate the design (usability testing). Identify and develop solutions to any design issues.</p><p><strong>6. Showcase your work.&nbsp;</strong>Provide your client or company with the design solution.</p><h1><strong>2.

      "body": "<p><strong>In short:&nbsp;</strong>The&nbsp;information architecture (IA)&nbsp;defines the overarching structure and relationship between all areas of a site (or multiple sites) and informs the sitemap; the&nbsp;sitemap&nbsp;lists all the (labelled) pages in entirety and shows hierarchy, structure and often page goals and content/functionality that happens to be on that particular page; and finally, the&nbsp;navigation&nbsp;guides users via links to all areas of a website.</p><h2>1. Information architecture (IA)</h2><p>An information architecture is usually done at the initial phases of a project. Main goal is to organise and structure all relevant entities — preferably in a user-centric way.</p><p><strong>Example 1:&nbsp;</strong>A retailer has websites for Australia and New Zealand, a blog, a community and a few social media channels. The AU website offers products/services for professionals and consumers, the NZ website only for consumers.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong>&nbsp;A globally operating company employs a corporate intranet and several country intranets in multiple languages. Some content is produced centralised and shared with countries (e.g. news, jobs, events).</p><p>All of these entities can operate or exist individually, but it’s the job of the IA to show how they can/should interact with each other, how content can be shared and how people will navigate from one entity to the other, i.e. how the anticipated userflow will work.</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Bx8hto9Fmyx0io9BosWN6w.jpeg\"></p><p>Example for an IA (of an intranet).</p><h2>2. Sitemap</h2><p>Based on user and business needs, and backed up by research (e.g. card sorting exercises), the sitemap is created, challenged and enhanced. One starting point for the new sitemap can be the old one, enhanced with additional analytics data or business/user values.</p><p>The sitemap artefact usually lists all the pages that will exist within the new solution, ideally with assigned page goals and content/functionality that will be placed on the pages. In addition to that should the sitemap also define the in-page information hierarchy (hierarchy of content).</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*0Qq6v1hB-bTgiUjCZHW3lw.png\"></p><p>Example of a sitemap with several “universes”.</p><h2>3. Navigation</h2><p>The navigation is the most important interface element that people will use to get to the pages defined by the sitemap. A website usually consists of these common navigational areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Main navigation.&nbsp;</strong>The main entryway for people to navigate the website, mostly task- and activity oriented, preferably user centric (= using the user’s language and adressing his or her mental models).</li><li><strong>Service navigation.&nbsp;</strong>Usually close to the main navigation, containing selected links that aren’t represented in the first level of the main navigation and functionality like login/register, language, and search.</li><li><strong>Footer navigation.&nbsp;</strong>Very often representing the main nav in some kind, with the option to show the partial sitemap. In addition, legal and compliance related links can be found here.</li><li>And in some instances:&nbsp;<strong>“Universe navigation”</strong>&nbsp;e.g. if a website adresses multiple audiences that each have a unique main navigation and/or experience, e.g.&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;professionals&nbsp;(predominantly seen on websites of financial institutions, utility providers, or insurance companies).</li></ul><p>While the sitemap shows one particular page only once at the defined location, the navigation can offer alternative pathways to that page (e.g. links that guide people to an&nbsp;About Us&nbsp;page can live in the footer and the service navigation, as well as in the content area itself).</p><p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*dka2BNeLTBJrr_EmycEFTA.png\"></p><p>Examples for navigation of apps and websites (on Pinterest).</p><p>A navigation can basically take any shape or form, but it should be user-centric, task-oriented, and last but not least, easy to use on any device.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Further reading</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ia-vs-navigation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Difference Between Information Architecture (IA) and Navigation</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/u/cc41e029efb3?source=post_page-----64eba19296c--------------------------------\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Cardello</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-information-architecture/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Complete Beginner’s Guide to Information Architecture</a>&nbsp;by UX Booth</li></ul>",

Flat sitemaps enhance discoverability of content because there are fewer levels to click through. The flattest sitemap consists of 1 vertical level, where different sections are placed on one page.</p><p>For&nbsp;<strong>medium</strong>&nbsp;sized (100+ pages), you can still create a flat sitemap but with a wider row of secondary pages. To surface those pages,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/3-click-rule/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">consider using a mega menu</a>&nbsp;that groups links into sub-categories to improve scanning.</p><p>For<strong>&nbsp;large</strong>&nbsp;sized (1,000+ pages), consider creating a deep sitemap to help house all the information, with 5+ vertical levels. Deep sitemaps can make it harder to discover content, so try to provide alternative ways (like menu shortcuts) to reach deeper pages. Category pages or navigation hubs can also help further organize the volume of pages (<a href=\"https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/architecture\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Backlinko</a>).</p><h2><strong>Why is it valuable?</strong></h2><p>A UX sitemap allows you to plan for usability, whether you’re working on a new website or a redesign (<a href=\"https://slickplan.com/blog/site-mapping-a-comprehensive-guide#para3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marie, 2018</a>). It provides a full overview, which then helps teams to simplify, trim off unnecessary pages, and keep what’s important. A UX sitemap also helps you see if linked pages are user and SEO friendly. With a sitemap, you can strategically place content where users would easily find it, and also pinpoint problem areas such pages hidden under an unintuitive label (<a href=\"https://theuxreview.co.uk/sitemaps-the-beginners-guide/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Mears, 2013</a>).</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Overall, a UX sitemap informs user-centered decisions in navigation, labeling, and organization.

The first one is to be versatile — after all, a product designer is not only the user’s advocate (just like UX designer), but also helps to achieve the client’s goals. Creativity and analytical thinking are needed, as well as the ability to cooperate with many stakeholders at once — clients, project managers, analysts, testers and developers. Their work not only leads to the creation of an interface that pleases the eye but, above all, to the success of the entire product. This includes conceptual work, strategy and implementation, which is focused on delivering real business value, not just positive UX.",
